In any case, the JAR-26 requirements should have been implemented already by EU operators and since the CS-26 text is equivalent to the JAR-26 text, compliance with JAR-26 means also compliance with Part-26 . See also Article 5 of the Commission Regulation (EU) 2015/640 In the rare case where the above possibilities are not sufficient, showing compliance by the operator directly to the NAA will be difficult. They will need to involve the design approval holder of the aircraft or the approved change as relevant.
