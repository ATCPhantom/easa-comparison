The “tool” to evaluate and show compliance with the minimum acceptable HQR will be derived from ADS-33E. The Mission Task Elements (MTE) manoeuvres of this military standard will be adapted to the SC VTOL based on the Concept of Operations (CONOPS) for VTOL that is being produced by industry. There will be also provisions on the competences of the test pilots (fixed wing or rotary wing background) and on the minimum number of evaluators. This tool is being developed together with industry and research centres, and will be published at a second stage.",

A pre-requisite to start the MHQRM process is thus to have Functional Hazard Assessment (FHA) available and have preliminary quantitative assessments for the FCs to be analysed in the MHQRM.

The most conservative external visual environment (Day, Night, IMC, NVIS) should be used for each phase of flight for which certification is requested.

When obvious interrelationships exist due to the design or the intended or expected operation of the aircraft, the way to address this within MHQRM is to modify the FE probability value . For example, for FltCs with Moderate and Severe AD levels in CRUISE and APPROACH, an atmospheric (windshear) event may require an escape operational procedure that results into entry in the LFE, resulting in a LFE probability of 10 0 ( i.e. 1 or certain ). Similarly, an aircraft flying at the boundaries of the NFE, may experience overspeed due to a gust and fall into the OFE, hence the modified FE would be 10 0 ( i.e. 1 or certain ). This probability adjustment concept would also apply to FCs where, for example, a loss of warnings or a loss of envelope protection might contribute to excursions outside the NFE or OFE, in which case the flight envelope probability should be increased appropriately. In this latter case, the change of probability will be evaluated case by case and should be agreed with the Agency ."

These eight areas are: fabrication requirements; basic constituent, pre- preg and laminate material acceptance requirements, and material property determination requirements; protection of structure; lightning protection; static strength evaluation; damage tolerance and fatigue evaluation; dynamic loading and response evaluation; and special repair and continued airworthiness requirements. Original as well as alternate or substitute material system constituents (e.g., fibers, resins), material systems (combinations of constituents and adhesives), and composite designs (e.g., laminates, cocured assemblies, bonded assemblies) should be qualified in accordance with the methodology presented in the following paragraphs. Each regulatory area will be addressed in turn. It is important to remember that proper certification of a composite structure is an incremental, building block process, which involves phased ” FAA/AUTHORITY EASA involvement and incremental approval in each of the various areas outlined herein. It is recommended that an FAA /AUTHORITY certification team approach be used for composite structural substantiation. The team should consist of FAA/AUTHORITY and cognizant members of the applicant’s organization. Personnel who are composites specialists (or are otherwise knowledgeable in the subject) should be primary team member candidates. Once selected, it is recommended that team meetings be held periodically (possibly in conjunction with type boards) during certification to ensure the building block certification process is accomplished as intended. The team should assure that permanent documentation in the form of reports or other FAA/AUTHORITY acceptable documents are included in the certification data package. The documentation includes but is not limited to the structural substantiation reports (both analysis and test), manufacturing processes and quality control, and Instructions for Continued Airworthiness (maintenance, overhaul, and repair manuals). The Airworthiness Limitations Section of the Instructions for Continued Airworthiness is approved by EASA FAA engineering. Engineering practices for many of the areas identified below are available in CMH-17.”"

Service experience of conventional aircraft has shown that damages due to high-energy fragments, for example following uncontained compressor and turbine rotor failures, continue to occur. VTOL capable aircraft have no service experience while the introduction of new technology and architectures means that VTOL capable aircraft cannot directly use conventional aircraft service experience to determine the likelihood and effects of failures. For Category Enhanced the failure of a lift/thrust unit or other rotating-machinery should therefore be assumed and the corresponding risk should be assessed, in line with the objective of VTOL.2250 (c), with specific considerations for simultaneous or cascading effects presented in this Particular Risk Analysis. For Category Basic, a lower safety objective, in line with VTOL.2510 and the current approach on conventional products, is accepted."

Indeed, traditional verification methods are usually effective for loss of function, but additional effort is often needed for more complex aspects (e.g. malfunction, unintended behaviour, cascading failures/faults, propagation effects, common mode errors). Furthermore, simulator benches and test rigs also offer flexibility to perform the evaluations with different scenarios and enable to check the impact of parameters’ variability.

Different levels of performance are also requested through the performance objectives of Continued Safe Flight and Landing and of Controlled Emergency Landing. This issue of the MOC adds considerations for incapacitation, serious injuries and fatalities in the definitions of Hazardous and Catastrophic failure conditions. For Category Basic, the definitions are similar to AC 23.1309-1E. For Category Enhanced fatalities are excluded in the definition of Hazardous failure conditions due to the high number of operations anticipated and the public safety expectations in the air taxi/urban air mobility context. This also aligns with the expected approach for RPAS where a fatality (on the ground) would be classified Catastrophic."
