Ignition sources include hot surfaces with temperatures at or above typical flash points for aviation fuels, oils, and hydraulic fluids, or any component that produces an electrical discharge. Compliance with this specification may be shown by installation of drainage shrouds around flammable fluid lines or fittings; installation of spray shields to deflect leaking fuel away from ignition sources, and general component location on the Engine which minimises the possibility of starting and supporting a fire. Therefore, the overall substantiation should show that leaked flammable fluid would be unlikely to impinge on an ignition source to the extent of starting and supporting a fire.",

        "text": "CS-E 650(g) applies to those Fault conditions that would cause abnormal vibrations that are difficult to identify in a timely manner so that appropriate mitigating action can be taken. Notwithstanding the provisions of CS-E 60 and CS-E 510 with regard to instrumentation, certain low-level vibrations caused by Fault conditions may not be recognised as associated with an Engine Fault and may not prompt an immediate response. Subsequently, these Faults may escalate to Hazardous Engine Effects. For example, the loss of an airfoil tip would be likely to result in a change in vibration due to the increased out-of-balance. Even if indicated by the means required under CS-E 60 and CS-E 510 , this vibration might not be immediately recognised as abnormal or may not prompt immediate action, and could cause further damage. Other Faults include incorrectly scheduled compressor variables, stator vanes blockages or enlargement, and blockages of fuel nozzles. These Faults could produce local airflow distortions and changes in the airflow or pressure distributions that in turn may affect component vibratory response and characteristics. To address these Fault conditions, the applicant may use prior experience with Faults that occurred on other similar Engines. Successful experience is such that, after exposure to a Fault condition, the Engine was able either to continue in safe operation or to be shut down without creating a Hazardous Engine Effect. Applicants may also use field experience or other means to show that certain Fault conditions are Extremely Remote because of specific Engine configurations, design features or operating conditions. The requirements of CS-E 650(g) apply to the same components that are considered under CS-E 650(a) . When the effects of these Fault conditions extend to the rest of the Engine, they must be addressed under the requirements of CS-E 100 Strength and/or CS E 520 Strength (for example, the out-of-balance effects on the Engine structural components).",

The strength of aerodynamic forcing on many turbine blades is predominantly driven by the total pressure levels, and the highest pressures are expected at the highest mechanical speed. Where turbines operate in aerodynamically choked conditions and the mass flow through the turbine is dictated by the fixed geometry of the blading, the corrected speed is essentially constant. Higher corrected speed (at an aerodynamic work level) will lower the blading Mach numbers (Mn) and, conversely, a lower corrected speed will increase blading Mn .

At low Engine power/thrust and high flight speed, the air intake specifications are minimal in comparison to the available ram air. Consequently, a significant portion of the air in front of the inlet spills outside the inlet lip (see Figure 1). Due to their mass, large rain droplets and hail are relatively unaffected by this spillage and will be captured by the inlet. The amount of rain or hail captured through the inlet will be established by the inlet highlight area. The amount of this amplification effect is equal to the ratio of the nacelle inlet highlight area (A h ) to the captured air stream tube area (A c ). This ratio is the scoop factor and it increases with decreasing Engine speed and increasing aircraft speed, due to the increase in inlet airflow spillage resulting from a smaller captured air stream tube. Further, by-pass turbofan engines may have an additional internal scoop factor effect due to the divergence of the Engine core stream tube from the nacelle inlet to the core inlet at low Engine power and high flight speed. Therefore although the scoop factor effect generally results in concentration amplification, the amplification is greatest when high flight speed is co mbined with low power / thrust.",

        "text": "The dispatch intervals for Short Time and Long Time dispatch will also depend upon the approach used in the maintenance programme. Where a “MEL Maintenance Approach” is used, and hence the time of initial occurrence of the Fault is known, the dispatch interval starts from the point in time when the MEL procedures identify the presence of the fault. In the “Inspection/Repair maintenance approach”, the Fault is assumed to have occurred half-way through the inspection interval and the dispatch interval is therefore assumed to have started accordingly from this mid-point. In each case, the analysis should support the dispatch interval(s). Table 3 shows an example of operating times for TLD Operations Associated with the “MEL Maintenance Approach” and with the “Inspection/Repair Maintenance Approach.”",
