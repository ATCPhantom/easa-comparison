Maintenance errors may also lead to a flotation unit failing to inflate. The ability of occupants to egress successfully is significantly increased if the rotorcraft does not sink. However, this requirement is not intended for any other purpose, such as aiding in the salvage of the rotorcraft. Therefore, consideration of the remaining flotation units remaining inflated for an especially long period, i.e. longer than required in the upright floating case, is not required.",

However, when a rotorcraft capsizes, doors may be unusable and the number and availability of emergency exits that can be readily used underwater will be crucial to ensuring that passengers are able to escape in a timely manner. Experience has shown that the number of emergency exits required in the past by design requirements has been inadequate in a capsized situation, and a common design solution has been to use the passenger cabin windows as additional emergency egress means by including a jettison feature. The jettison feature has commonly been provided by modifying the elastomeric window seal such that its retention strength is either reduced, or can be reduced by providing a removable part of its cross section, i.e. the so called ‘push out’ window, although other design solutions have been employed. The provision of openable windows has been required by some air operations regulations.",

The time available for evacuation is very short in such situations, and therefore, CS-29 Amendment 5 has increased the safety level by mandating additional exits, in the form of underwater emergency exits, to both shorten available escape routes and to ensure that no occupant should need to wait for more than one other person to escape before being able to make their own escape. The provision of an underwater emergency exit in each side of the fuselage of at least the size of a Type IV exit for each unit (or part of a unit) of four passenger seats will make this possible, provided that seats are positioned relative to the exits in a favourable manner.",

Where it is impractical for guide bars to be run across the full width of the cabin, e.g. due to the presence of an aisle, the ends of the guide bars should be designed to make them easier to find, e.g. enlarged and highlighted/lit end fittings to provide additional visual and tactile location cues.

The helicopter handling with different cable conditions should include lateral transitions and quick stops up to the helicopter approved low airspeed limitations.

Those currents can generate significant voltages in closely spaced wiring that, if allowed to reach some squib designs, could activate the device. Shielding, bonding, and grounding of wiring associated with operation of the hoist and the quick-release mechanism should be clearly and adequately evaluated in design and certification. When recognised good practices for such installation are applied, an analysis may be sufficient to highlight that the maximum possible pulse generated into the squib circuit will have an energy content orders of magnitude below the squib no-fire energy. If insufficient data is available for the installation and/or the squib no fire energy, this evaluation may require testing. One acceptable test method to demonstrate the adequacy of QRS shielding, bonding, and grounding would be to actuate the hoist under maximum load, together with likely critical combinations of other aircraft electrical loads, and demonstrate that the test squibs (which are more EMI sensitive than the squibs specified for use in the QRS) do not inadvertently operate during the test.",

External fixtures are not approvable as jettisonable external cargo because they do not have a true payload (see definition), true jettison capability (see definition), or a complete QRS. Many AI designs can dump their solid or liquid chemical loads by use of a ‘purge port’ release over a relatively long time period (i.e. greater than 30 seconds). This is not considered to be a true jettison capability (see definition) since the external load is not released by a QRS and since the release time span is typically greater than 30 seconds (ref.: b(20) and c(7)). Thus, these types of AIs should be approved as non-jettisonable external loads. However, other designs that have the entire AI (or significant portions thereof) attached to the rotorcraft, that have short time frame jettison (or release) capabilities provided by QRSs that meet the definitions herein and that have no post-jettison characteristics that would endanger continued safe flight and landing may be approved as jettisonable external loads.

        "text": "Compliance is usually shown by conducting actual in-flight restarts during flight tests or other tests in accordance with an approved test plan. However, CS 29.903 (e)(2) does not require in-flight demonstration of restart capability for single-engine rotorcraft or for all-engine shutdown of multi-engine rotorcraft. In the past, engine restart capability for single-engine rotorcraft has been demonstrated on the ground taking into account altitude effects, warm engine characteristics, depleted battery, etc. However, latest-technology engines embody electronic engine controls (EEC or FADEC) that may have sophisticated starting or restarting laws. For these designs the engine restart capability demonstrated on ground may not provide the level of representativeness required and therefore applicants are encouraged to demonstrate the capability in flight. The minimum restart envelope for category A rotorcraft is discussed in AC 29.903A. The restart capability can consider windmilling of the engine as part of this restart capability; however, most rotorcraft airspeeds and the locations of the engines do not support engine windmilling up to start speeds. Only electrical power requirements were considered for restarting; however, other factors that may affect this capability are permitted to be considered. Engine restart capability following an in-flight shutdown of the engine in single-engine rotorcraft, or all engines in a multi-engine rotorcraft, is the primary requirement, and the means of providing this capability is left to the applicant. To minimise any potential altitude loss following the failure of one or more engines, engine restart should be available at the earliest opportunity. The engine certification should be checked to ensure that the flight manual instructions for in-flight restart are consistent with any specific engine restart requirements. If the procedure was only demonstrated on ground, this should be stated in the RFM.",

However, these agents are significantly heavier and occupy a greater volume than Halon 1211. This may indirectly (i.e. additional weight of the fire extinguisher and additional weight of the structures supporting it), increase CO2 emissions.

Flight test does not normally allow the manipulation of the operational environment which may be needed to apply the scenario-based approach. HFs in-flight scenarios may be challenging to replicate due to the difficulty in reproducing the operational context. For example, events like ATC communications, weather, etc., which are expected to trigger a crew reaction to be tested may not be repeatable. This may hamper the collection of homogeneous data and may adversely affect its validity. However, flight test is deemed adequate when the operational and/or system representativeness is a key driver for the validity of HFs data. For example, an in-flight assessment is typically more adequate when dealing with workload determination."

This is because the process for threshold setting is sometimes a compromise between increasing sensitivity and incurring a higher risk of false alarms, or reducing sensitivity, which will delay the point at which a rising indicator value will trigger an alert. In-service experience has shown that MGB component fatigue failures can propagate from initiation to failure in a relatively short period of time, thus the use of fixed thresholds alone may not provide a timely indication of impending failure. One characteristic that can often provide an earlier indication of anomalous behaviour is the rate of change of a health monitoring indicator, and automatic trend detection software has been developed and shown to be effective. Another method, commonly referred to as Advanced Anomaly Detection (AAD), combines numerous indicators into multi-dimensional parameters, whereby simultaneous changes of multiple indicators can provide increased confidence of the anomalous behaviour at an earlier point in the failure process.

        "text": "The all-engines-operating V NE is established by design and substantiated by flight tests. The V NE limit s are the most conservative value that demonstrates compliance with the structural requirements ( CS 29.309 ), the manoeuvrability and controllability requirements ( CS 29.143 ), the stability requirements ( CS 29.173 and CS 29.175 ), or the vibration requirements ( CS 29.251 ). The Power-ON V NE will normally decrease as density altitude or weight increases. A variation in rotor speed may also require a variation in the V NE . The regulation restricts to two the number of variables that are used to determine the V NE at any given time so that a single pilot can readily ascertain the correct V NE for the flight condition with a minimum of mental effort. Helicopter manufacturers have typically presented never-exceed-speed limitation data as a function of pressure altitude and temperature. This information was placarded as well as contained in the flight manual. As the weight of some derivative models was increased, EASA and the FAA accepted altitude/temperature/ V NE limitations that were categorised or contained within a weight range. Literal compliance with the regulation then required that the take-off weight be calculated and then the indicated, appropriate airspeed limitation chart or placard be used for the entire flight. However, V NE charts or placards based on longitudinal centre of gravity have been found to be unacceptable, since the same chart would potentially not be used throughout the flight and the pilot would thus be dealing with more than two variables to determine the V NE . Alternatively, rotorcraft that are equipped with modern avionics systems may be able to automatically calculate and display the V NE in an unambiguous manner as a function of the different parameters upon which it depends. For these designs, the applicant is expected to appropriately address the criticality associated with the loss and misleading presentation of the V NE when compliance of such systems with CS 29.1309 is carried out . These rotorcraft should also have a method for determining the V NE that complies with the regulation for all failure conditions or combinations of failure conditions that are not extremely improbable. This method is usually more conservative than the automatic system because of the limitation in the number of parameters that can be varied. A placard may be used or appropriate RFM instructions.",

Previous rotorcraft cold weather tests have shown that the rotor system may exhibit several undesirable and possibly hazardous characteristics due to compressibility effects at high advancing blade tip Mach numbers. As the centre of pressure of the advancing rotor blade moves aft near the blade tip due to the formation of localised upper surface shock waves, rotor system loads may increase, the rotor system may exhibit an aerodynamic instability such as rotor weave, rotorcraft vibration may increase substantially, and rotorcraft static or dynamic stability may be adversely affected. Which, if any, of these adverse characteristics are exhibited at high rotor tip Mach numbers is dependent on the design of each particular rotor system. EASA and the FAA experience has shown that some adverse characteristics exist for all the types of rotor systems (articulated, semirigid, rigid, etc.) and the various rotor blade designs evaluated at high advancing blade tip Mach numbers during past certification programmes. Therefore, it has been EASA and the FAA policy to establish V NE so that it is not more than 0.9 times the maximum speed substantiated for advancing blade tip Mach number effects for the critical combination of altitude, approved Power-ON rotor speed, and ambient temperature conditions. This policy was incorporated as a specific regulatory requirement with Amendment 29-24 to § 29.1505. High main rotor tip Mach numbers obtained power off at higher-than-normal main rotor rotational speeds should not be used to establish the maximum Power-ON tip Mach number V NE limit. In addition, since the onset of adverse conditions associated with high tip Mach numbers can occur with little or no warning and amplify very rapidly, no extrapolation of the maximum demonstrated main rotor tip Mach number V NE limitation should be allowed.",

TOP is intended for use during take-off and climb for not more than 5 minutes at relatively low airspeeds. However, EASA and the FAA experience has shown that pilots will not hesitate to use TOP at much higher than best-rate-of-climb airspeeds unless a specific limitation against TOP use above a specified airspeed is included in the RFM. Structural and fatigue substantiations have not normally included loads associated with the use of TOP at V NE . Thus, a TOP airspeed limitation should be established from the structural substantiation data to preclude the accumulation of damaging rotor system and control mechanism loads through intentional use of the TOP rating at high airspeeds.",

It is possible that a rotorcraft with more than two engines could have different V NE speeds depending upon the number of engines still operating. It is recommended that the OEI V NE not be significantly lower than the OEI best range airspeed.

A limitation of the Power-OFF V NE may also be used if the rotorcraft has undesirable or objectionable flying qualities, such as large lateral-directional oscillations, at high autorotational airspeeds. The Power-OFF V NE must meet the same criteria for control margins as the Power-ON V NE . The regulation requires that the Power-OFF V NE be no less than the speed midway between the Power-ON V NE and the speed used to comply with the rate of climb requirements for the rotorcraft. When the regulation was written, rotorcraft V NE speeds were significantly lower than those of recently certificated rotorcraft. The high V NE speeds of current rotorcraft result in relatively high values for the Power-OFF V NE . Speeds lower than th ose specified in the regulation have been found acceptable through a finding of equivalent safety if the selected Power-OFF V NE is equal to or greater than the Power-OFF speed for best range. In any case, the Power-OFF V NE must be a high enough speed to be practical.

In addition, the inspection findings can determine whether parts are sufficiently protected and whether they remain in serviceable condition. In summary, the overhaul of the gearbox is intended to verify the condition of its elements, restore them to a serviceable condition or replace them where needed, and ensure that the gearbox will be safe for operation until the following overhaul.

The NVGs for civil use are based on performance criteria in ETSO-C164 and RTCA Document DO-275. These NVGs are known as ‘Class B NVG’ because they have filters applied to the objective lenses that block energy below the wavelength of 665 nanometres (nm). The Class B objective lens filter allows more use of colour in the cockpit, with truer reds and ambers. The ETSO specifies Class B NVGs for civil use. Because NVGs will amplify energy that is not within the range of the filter, it is important that the NVIS lighting system keeps those incompatible frequencies out of the cockpit. However, there are NVGs in civil use that do not conform to the ETSO-C164 standard because they have Class A filters on their objective lenses. Class A filters block energy below the wavelength of 625 nm. As a result, Class A NVGs amplify more wavelengths of visible light, so they require special care in the use of colour in the cockpit. Applicants are advised that Class A NVGs are deemed to be not acceptable for certification by EASA.",
