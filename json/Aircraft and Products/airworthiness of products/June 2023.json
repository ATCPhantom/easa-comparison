These system elements or sub-systems can be fuel control, or ignition control, or others. If a system were to contain only one element such as fuel control, then the appropriate total system level would be 15 LOPC events per million engine flight hours. So the system elements are then additive up to a max of 45 LOPC events per million hours. For example, an EEC system comprised of fuel, ignition, and wastegate control functions should meet a total system reliability of 15+15+15 = 45 LOPC events per million engine flight hours. This criterion is then applied to the entire system and not allocated to each of the subsystems. Note that a maximum of 45 LOPC events per million engine flight hours are allowed, regardless of the number of subsystems. For example, if the EEC system includes more than three subsystems, the sum of the LOPC rates for the total system should not exceed 45 LOPC events per million engine flight hours for all of the elect rical and electronic elements.",

The airline host, or the flight crew, in it iates the process for the generation of the PDC by subm it ting the flight plan information to the air traffic service, which in turn forwards the flight strip information to the appropriate airport control tower. Approximately 30 minutes before the aircraft is scheduled to depart, the approved PDC is transm it ted from the tower via ground-ground data link to the airline host computer. The airline host responds with an acknowledgement that ultimately feeds back to the tower PDC workstation. Depending upon the airline capabilities, the PDC may then be transmitted directly to the aircraft flight deck via the ACARS data link. If the aircraft is not equipped w it h ACARS, the approved PDC is sent to an airport gate printer for delivery by hand in printed format to the aircraft. For a clearance requested from the aircraft, the flight crew will in it iate a PDC request via the ACARS data link network to the airline host computer. The host will then respond via the ACARS network w it h the approved PDC."

Regulatory and i ndustry experts agreed that, as the transport aircraft fleet continues to age, eventually w idespread f atigue d amage (WFD) is inevitable. Structures Task Groups sponsored by the Task Force were assigned the task of developing these elements into usable programmes. The Task Force was later re established as the AAWG of the ARAC. Although there was JAA membership and European o perators and i ndustry representatives participated in the AAWG, recommendations for action focussed on FAA operational rules which are not applicable in Europe. It was therefore decided to establish the EAAWG on this subject to implement a geing a ircraft activities in Europe , not only for the initial ‘ AATF eleven ’ aeroplanes, but also other old aircraft and more recently certified ones. EAAWG recommendations followed, leading to the development of guidance material for TCHs and operators, and proposals to develop Sub-part M of JAR OPS. The subsequent establishment of the Agency and new EU regulations led to the current format of Part-M for continuing airworthiness, the associated maintenance programme requirements and to the inclusion of ageing aircraft structures programmes in AMC Part M (M.A.302). AMC 20-20 supported this process and set out means by which TCHs and operators could develop and implement ageing aircraft structures programmes.",

The Regulation includes requirements for specific DAHs to perform damage tolerance and other evaluations of existing airframe structure, develop certain data and ICA if they have not already done so, and make it available to operators. Furthermore, operators, in addition to implementing these new ICA as envisaged under Part-M, are required by Part-26 to ensure that approved damage-tolerance-based inspections are obtained and implemented on all repairs and modifications affecting the FCS on aeroplanes certified for 30 passengers or more or for 7 500 lb or more payload.",

It is standard practice to interpret the non-factored fatigue life of one specimen as the average life.

Based on this, and assuming that the susceptible areas are impractical to inspect for MSD/MED, the replacement or modification should be implemented at X/3.

Depending on the results, crack growth analyses may also be required to project backwards or forwards in time to estimate the WFD (average behaviour) for an area. As a minimum, teardown inspection methods should be capable of detecting the minimum size of MSD or MED cracking that would result in a WFD condition (i.e. residual strength degraded to less than the level specified in CS 25.571(b)). Ideally, it is recommended that inspection methods should be used that are capable of detecting MSD/MED cracking before it degrades the strength to less than the required level. Effective teardown inspections that are required to demonstrate freedom from WFD typically require significant resources.

When identifying FCBS, it is not sufficient to consider only that structure identified in the SSID or ALS. Some SSIDs or ALSs might only include supplemental inspections of the most highly stressed elements of the FCBS. A n SSID or ALS often refer s to this structure as a PSE. If repaired, other areas of structure not identified as a PSE in the SSID or ALS may require supplemental inspections. The term PSE has, at times, been interpreted narrowly by industry. The narrow application of the term PSE could incorrectly limit the scope of the structure that would be considered relative to fatigue if repairs or modifications exist or are made su bsequently. The relationship between PSE and FCS could vary significantly depending on the TCH’s working definition of PSE. In addition, there may be structure whose failure would be catastrophic, but due to low operational loads on the part, the part will not experience fatigue cracking. However, if the subject part is repaired or modified, the stresses in the part may be increased to a level where it is now susceptible to fatigue cracking. These types of parts should be considered as FCS .",

However, for some older aircraft, a review of records alone may not always be adequate to identify all the modifications that have an adverse effect on FCBS, or be sufficient to establish whether a DTE has been accomplished and DTI is complete, without requesting such information from the DAH. Physical inspection of the aircraft may help establish the scope of the modification if it is unclear from the records.

A DTE entails the prediction of sites where fatigue cracks are most likely to initiate in the aircraft’s structure, the prediction of the crack path and rates of growth under repeated aircraft structural loading, the prediction of the size of the damage at which strength limits are exceeded, and an analysis of the potential opportunities for inspection of the damage as it progresses.

These documents were derived from damage tolerance assessments of the originally certified type designs for these aeroplanes. For this reason, the majority of ADs written for the SSIP did not attempt to address the issues related to the damage tolerance of repairs that had been made to the aeroplanes.

Inspections may be adequate at this early stage, when cracking is possible, but not highly likely. However, as aircraft age, the probability of fatigue cracking becomes more likely. During this later period, it is not prudent to rely only on inspections alone because there are more opportunities for cracks to be missed, and cracks may no longer occur in isolation. It is then prudent to reduce reliance strictly on inspections, with their inherent human factors limitations, and to incorporate modifications to the structure to eliminate the source of the cracking. In some cases, reliance on an inspection programme, in lieu of modification, may be acceptable through the increased use of mandatory versus non-mandatory inspections.",

Aircraft manufacturers specify clamp type and part number for EWIS throughout the aircraft. When replacing clamps use those specified by the aircraft manufacturer. Tie wraps provide a rapid method of clamping especially during line maintenance operations. Improperly installed tie wraps can have a detrimental effect on wire insulation. When new wiring is installed as part of a STC or any other modification the drawings will provide wiring routing, clamp type and size, and proper location. Examples of significant wiring modifications are the installation of new avionics systems, new galley installations and new instrumentation. Wire routing, type of clamp and clamping location should conform to the approved drawings. Adding new wire to existing wire bundles may overload the clamps causing wire bundle to sag and wires to chafe.

Maintenance personnel need to be aware that aeroplane EWIS should be maintained with the same level of intensity as any other system in the aeroplane. They also need to recognise that visual inspection of wiring has inherent limitations. Small defects such as breached or cracked insulation, especially in small gage wire may not always be apparent. Therefore, effective wiring maintenance combines visual inspection techniques with improved wiring maintenance practices and training.",

Many different impact scenarios and locations should be considered in the survey, which has a goal of identifying the most critical impacts possible (i.e., those causing the most serious damage but are least detectable). When simulating accidental impact damage at representative energy levels, blunt or sharp impactors of different sizes and shapes should be selected to cause the most critical and least detectable damage, according to the load conditions (e.g., tension, compression or shear).

For example, changing from first to second generation of carbon fibres may improve tensile strength properties by more than 20% and a new acceptability threshold will be needed in the specification of the alternate material to ensure the detection o f quality variations.",

Table 1 provides the corresponding failure condition classification and system lightning certification level (LCL) for the appropriate lightning regulations. The failure condition classifications and terms used in this AMC are similar to those used in AC 23.1309-1E, AMC 25.1309, AC-27-1B, and AC-29-2C, as applicable. Only those systems identified as performing or contributing to functions whose failure would result in catastrophic, hazardous, or major failure conditions are subject to lightning regulations. Based on the safety classification of the failure condition established by the safety assessment, the systems should be assigned appropriate system LCLs, as shown in Table 1. The lightning safety assessment should consider the common - cause effects of lightning, particularly for highly integrated systems and systems with redundant elements. The lightning safety assessment determines the consequences of failures for the aircraft functions that are performed by the system. The system LCL classification assigned to the systems and functions can be different from the d evelopment a ssurance l evel (DAL) (ED-79A/ARP 4754A) / d esign a ssurance l evel (DAL) (ED 80/DO-254 , ED-12C/DO-178C ) assigned for equipment redundancy, software, and airborne electronic hardware (AEH). This is because lightning is an environment that can cause common - cause effects. The term ‘design assurance level’ or ‘ development assurance level’ ( both abbreviated to ‘ DAL ’ ) should not be used to describe the system LCL because of the potential differences in the assigned classifications for software, AEH, and equipment redundancy. The lightning safety assessment must include all electrical and electronic equipment, components and electrical interconnections, assuming that they are potentially affected by lightning. It is not appropriate to use the lightning immunity data for electrical and electronic equipment, components and electrical interconnections as an information input to the lightning safety assessment. This information should only be used in the next phase, to show compliance with the applicable subpart of the lightning regulation, after the required LCL for the system is defined by the lightning safety assessment. The lightning safety assessment results from inputs coordinated between the safety specialist, the system specialist, and the HIRF/ l ightning specialist. This process may vary from applicant to applicant. Further details on performing the safety assessment can be found in AC 23.1309-1E, AMC 25.1309, AC-27-1B, AC-29-2C, EUROCAE ED 79A, SAE ARP 4761, and EUROCAE ED-158.",

This is because aircraft transfer function tests and in-service experience have shown that these redundant and spatially separated installations are not simultaneously exposed to the maximum lightning-induced transients. Therefore, the simultaneous loss of all these redundant and spatially separated Level B or Level C systems due to lightning exposure does not need to be considered. However, if multiple systems and their wirings, wh ose failure would reduce the capability of the a e r o plane or the ability of the flight crew to respond to an adverse operating condition, are installed within the same location in the aircraft, or share a common wiring connection, then the combined failure due to lightning exposure should be assessed to determine whether the combined failures are catastrophic.

The mechanical channel must provide overspeed protection during normal operations, and be independent of the active electronic control channels. The mechanical channel must not rely on electrical or electronic components to assist, augment, or monitor the overspeed protection. If the mechanical channel is independent of the electronic engine control speed control and overspeed protection, and has no electrical or electronic components that have failure modes that could prevent overspeed protection, then the engine overspeed protection function is not adversely affected when the aircraft is exposed to lightning. The system is , therefore , not subject to CS 25.1316(a). The electronic engine control channels should comply with CS 25.1316(b) with LCL B. This example only considers the overspeed protection feature implemented by the system. Other functions whose failure may be classified as catastrophic, like the loss of thrust control function where the function may be implemented by electronic control channels, should comply with CS 25.1316(a)."

In this case, each system implements very distinct aircraft - level functions that serve in a complementary manner to decelerate the aircraft during the landing roll. The mechanical wheel braking system is assumed to be independent of the other channels, with no associated electrical or electronic equipment to assist, augment, or monitor the mechanical wheel braking system. In this example, it is assumed that the main brake system includes failure conditions that are catastrophic. For the electronic engine thrust reverser control and the electronic spoiler control systems, the applicable parts of CS 25.1316 would depend on the specific failure conditions. The effectiveness, authority, and malfunctions associated with each system should be considered. Additionally, the interaction between the systems has also to be considered. Issues such as asymmetrical thrust reverser activation or spoiler deployment could adversely affect the main brake and mechanical wheel braking functions and could affect the safety classification for the thrust reverser and spoiler controls. An aircraft safety assessment must be carried out for each of these systems performing a specific aircraft - level function to identify and classify their failure conditions. The failure hazard classifications and the decomposition of each system into the constituent channels would then dictate which paragraphs of CS 25.1316 are needed."

Table 1 provides the corresponding failure condition classification and system HIRF certification level (HCL) for the appropriate HIRF requirements . The failure condition classifications and terms used in this AMC are similar to those used in AC 23.1309-1E, AMC 25.1309, AC-27-1B, and AC-29-2C, as applicable. Only those systems identified as performing or contributing to functions whose failure would result in catastrophic, hazardous, or major failure conditions are subject to HIRF requirements . Based on the safety classification of the failure condition classification by the safety assessment, the systems should be assigned appropriate HCLs, as shown in Table 1. The HIRF safety assessment should consider the common - cause effects of HIRF, particularly for highly integrated systems and systems with redundant elements. The HIRF safety assessment determines the consequences of failures for the aircraft functions that are performed by the system. The system HCL classification assigned to the systems and functions can be different from the d evelopment a ssurance l evel (ED-79A) or the d esign a ssurance l evel (ED-80) assigned for equipment redundancy, software, and airborne electronic hardware (AEH). This is because HIRF is an environment that can cause common - cause effects. The term ‘ DAL ’ should not be used to describe the system HCL because of the potential differences in assigned classifications for software, AEH, and equipment redundancy. The HIRF safety assessment must include all electrical and electronic equipment, components and electrical interconnections, assuming that they are potentially affected by HIRF. It is not appropriate to use the HIRF immunity data for electrical and electronic equipment, components and electrical interconnections as information input for the HIRF safety assessment. This information should only be used in the next phase, to show compliance with the applicable subpart of the HIRF requirements , after the required HCL for the system is defined by the HIRF safety assessment. The HIRF safety assessment must have input and be coordinated between the safety specialist, the system specialist, and the HIRF/ l ightning specialist. This process may vary from applicant to applicant. Further guidance on performing the safety assessment can be found in AC 23.1309-1E, AMC 25.1309, AC-27-1B, AC-29-2C, SAE ARP 4754A / EUROCAE ED-79A, SAE ARP 4761, and ARP 5583A / EUROCAE ED 107A.",

The mechanical channel must provide overspeed protection during normal operations, and be independent of the active electronic control channels. The mechanical channel must not rely on electrical or electronic components to assist, augment, or monitor the overspeed protection. If the mechanical channel is independent of the electronic engine control speed control and overspeed protection, and has no electrical or electronic components that have failure modes that could prevent overspeed protection, then the engine overspeed protection function is not adversely affected when the aircraft is exposed to HIRF E nvironment I and II. The system is , therefore , not subject to CS 25.1317(a). The electronic engine control channels should comply with CS 25.1317(b). This example only considers the overspeed protection feature implemented by the system. Other functions whose failure may be classified as catastrophic, such as the loss of thrust control function where the function may be implemented by electronic control channels, should comply with CS 25.1317(a)."

In this case, each system implements a very distinct aircraft - level function that serves in a complementary manner to decelerate the aircraft during the landing roll. The mechanical wheel braking system is assumed to be independent of the other channels, with no associated electrical or electronic equipment to assist, augment, or monitor the mechanical wheel braking system. In this example, it is assumed that the main brake system includes failure conditions that are catastrophic. For the electronic engine thrust reverser control and the electronic spoiler control systems, the applicable parts of CS 25.1317 would depend on the specific failure conditions. The effectiveness, authority, and malfunctions associated with each system should be considered. Additionally, the interaction between the systems has also to be considered. Issues such as asymmetrical thrust reverser activation or spoiler deployment could adversely affect the main brake and mechanical wheel braking functions and could affect the safety classification for the thrust reverser and spoiler controls. An aircraft safety assessment must be carried out for each of these systems that perform a specific aircraft - level function to identify and classify their failure conditions. The failure hazard classifications and the decomposition of each system into the constituent channels would then dictate which paragraphs of CS 25.1317 are needed."

The ‘Process’ classification in AMC 20-189 should be used for PRs that record a process non-compliance or deficiency, provided they cannot result in a potential safety or potential functional effect. An example of an OPR that should not be classified as a ‘Process’ PR is one related to a requirement that was not completely verified due to a process deficiency, because the potential safety or functional impact remains undetermined.
