In order to take credit from ISO/IEC 27001 certifications to achieve compliance with Part-IS , aviation safety needs to be included in the organisational risk management, with the relevant risk acceptance level determined by the applicable regulation (see Figure 5).

If an ISO/IEC 27001-based ISMS is already operated by an entity for a different scope and context, it can be adapted and extended to the scope and context of this Regulation in a straightforward manner based on an analysis of the scope and the gaps. In order to take credit from ISO/IEC 27001 certifications to achieve compliance with Part-IS , aviation sa fety needs to be included in the organisational risk management, with the relevant risk acceptance level determined by the applicable regulation (see Figure 5). Therefore, careful determination of the scope of the ISMS related to aviation safety risks is needed, as it might differ from the one related to the other organisational risks. To allow demonstration of compliance with Regulation (EU) 2023/203, careful delineation between aspects of the ISMS related to aviation safety risks and other organisational risks may be required. This could have an influence upon the decision to integrate ISMSs."

In order to take credit from ISO/IEC 27001 certifications to achieve compliance with Part-IS , aviation safety needs to be included in the organisational risk management, with the relevant risk acceptance level determined by the applicable regulation (see Figure 5). Therefore, careful determination of the scope of the ISMS related to aviation safety risks is needed, as it might differ from the one related to the other organisational risks. To allow demonstration of compliance with Regulation (EU) 2022/1645 , careful delineation between aspects of the ISMS related to aviation safety risks and other organisational risks may be required.
