As the nature of hazards, risks, and mitigation measure s are specific to each of these four areas, the methodologies employed by Member States to identify hazards, assess risks, and plan appropriate mitigation measure s should fit the specific needs of the area assessed, and of each Member State. Nevertheless, the assessment should guarantee that the risk is acceptable or tolerable while identifying the requirements that are to be met in that perspective. Ultimately , the appropriate mitigation measure s from each assessment should be compatible with each other and they should not adversely impact on the other areas.",

An organisation may use PIs to evaluate its success, or to evaluate the success of a particular activity in which it is engaged. Sometimes success is defined in terms of making progress towards strategic goals, but often success is simply the repeated, periodic achievement of some level of operational goal (e.g. zero defects). Accordingly, choosing the right PIs relies upon a good understanding of what is important to the organisation. Since there is a need to ensure a relevant assessment, various techniques to assess the present state of the business, and its key activities, are associated with the selection of appropriate PIs. These assessments often lead to the identification of potential improvements, so PIs are routinely associated with performance improvement initiatives. When PIs have performance targets associated with them, they are known as key performance indicators (KPIs)."
