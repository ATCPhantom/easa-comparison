The SORA provides a methodology to guide both the UAS operator and the competent authority in determining whether a UAS operation can be conducted in a safe manner. The document should not be used as a checklist, nor be expected to provide answers to all the challenges related to the integration of the UAS in the airspace. The SORA is a tailoring guide that allows a UAS operator to find a best fit mitigation means, and hence reduce the risk to an acceptable level. For this reason, it does not contain prescriptive requirements, but rather safety objectives to be met at various levels of robustness, commensurate with the risk.",

For example, for operations below 120 m, the traffic avoidance manoeuvres are expected to mostly be based on a rapid descent to an altitude where manned aircraft are not expected to ever operate.",

For operations requesting only a low level of integrity for this OSO, this could be achieved by monitoring the C2 link signal strength and receiving an alert from the UAS HMI if the signal strength becomes too low."

Note 2: The proposed additional safety conditions do not imply a systematic need to develop the SW and AEH according to an industry standard or methodology recognised as adequate by the competent authority. For instance, if the UA design includes an independent engine shutdown function that systematically prevents the UA from exiting the ground risk buffer due to single failures or an SW/AEH error of the flight controls from occurring, the intent of the conditions of point  6.13.1 above could be considered met. Note 3: For this PDRA, having adjacent airspace classified as ARC-c like a hospital heliport in uncontrolled airspace is also deemed subject to the above additional conditions (in addition to ARC-d, as per SORA Step #9 (c))."

Some national laws use the sunset and sunrise times for the definition of a night flight. ‘Sunset’ is defined as the daily disappearance of the upper limb of the sun below the horizon. This time depends on the latitude and longitude of the viewpoint. There are many websites and apps to find out the sunset and sunrise times at a specific location. Recognise the benefits of illuminating the operational area, especially during the critical phases of take-off and landing. Recognise that during night flight it is hard to estimate the distance between the UA and other obstacles if visibility is only ensured by the lights of the UA. Recognise that a visual obstacle avoidance system may be less accurate in night-time operations. Understand that if the sight of the UA is lost at night, return-to-home (RTH) should be immediately followed. Rationale: During daytime, it is sometimes difficult to see the position of the UA, which is even more difficult at night. Recognise that an infrared radiation (IR) camera allows one to see enough at night. Turning off the front green flashing light might improve the view because there will be no reflection in the on-board camera. Recognise that the IR camera does not help in case of rain/humidity, and that the IR visibility significantly decreases. Explain the use of the green flashing light at night. Explain the use of navigation lights, position lights, anti-collision lights, and other lights for UA controllability. Explain the use of lights ( e.g. navigation, position, or anti-collision lights) for recognising the presence of manned aircraft. Rationale: Those lights show where the UA is positioned and the direction in which the UA is aligned. For manned aircraft, a red navigation light is located on the leading edge of the left-wing tip and a green navigation light on the leading edge of the rightwing tip (for helicopters, on the left and right sides of the cockpit). A white navigation light is positioned on the tail as far aft as possible. High-intensity strobe lights are also located in those positions. They are used as anti-collision lights and flash twice after a short break. A red rotating beacon is also part of the anti-collision lights."

Collision threats are present everywhere. Before take-off, the remote pilot should visually check the take-off area to ensure that there are no other objects.

Rationale: In mountainous environment, the wind blows smoothly on the windward side of the mountain. On the leeward side, the wind follows the contours of the terrain and can be quite turbulent: this is called a katabatic wind. The stronger the wind, the higher the downward pressure. Such a wind will push the UA down towards the surface of the mountain. If the remote pilot does not know how to recognise a downdraft, which is downward moving air, the situation can become quite challenging."
