        <para>EASA eRules: aviation rules for the 21st century</para>
        <para>Rules are the core of the EU civil aviation system. The aim of the EASA eRules project is to make them accessible to stakeholders in an efficient and reliable way.</para>
        <para>EASA eRules is a comprehensive, single system for structuring, sharing, and storing of rules. It is the single, easy-access online database for all aviation safety rules applicable to persons and organisations subject to Basic Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2018/1139).</para>
        <para>The Easy Access Rules (EAR) are the output of the eRules project. The EAR books are consolidated versions of those rules, combining EU regulations with the related EASA Executive Director (ED) decisions in an easy-to-read format with advanced navigation features through links and bookmarks. The EAR books are regularly updated, following the adoption of an official publication.</para>
        <para>The EAR books are available:</para>
        <para>in PDF format;</para>
        <para>as dynamic online publications (online format) with a wide range of functionalities, such as filters to obtain regulatory material tailored to one&#8217;s needs, a search function through the table of contents to quickly access the relevant sections, and easy navigation for computers, tablets, and mobiles; and</para>
        <para>in XML (machine-readable) format that can be easily processed and automated by recipients, producing output that is compatible and can be synchronised with local applications, search databases, etc.</para>
        <para>The EASA eRules system is developed and implemented in close cooperation with the Member States and aviation industry to ensure that all its capabilities are relevant and effective.</para>

        <para>Disclaimer</para>
        <para>This document is issued by the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (referred to as both &#8216;EASA&#8217; and &#8216;the Agency&#8217;) to provide its stakeholders with an updated, consolidated, and easy-to-read publication. It has been prepared by putting together the officially published EU regulations with the related EASA acceptable means of compliance (AMC) and guidance material (GM) (including the amendments) adopted so far. However, this is not an official publication, and EASA accepts no liability for damage of any kind resulting from the risks inherent in its use.</para>

        <para>Regulation (EU) 923/2012</para>
        <para>THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,</para>
        <para>Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,</para>
        <para>Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 551/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 10 March 2004 on the organisation and use of the airspace in the single European sky(the airspace Regulation), and in particular Article 4(a) and (b) thereof,</para>
        <para>Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 216/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 February 2008 on common rules in the field of civil aviation and establishing a European Aviation Safety Agency (the EASA Basic Regulation), and in particular Articles 8 and 8b and Annex Vb thereto,</para>
        <para>Whereas:</para>
        <para>(1)Pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 551/2004 and Regulation (EC) No 216/2008, the Commission is required to adopt implementing rules in order to adopt appropriate provisions on rules of the air based upon Standards and recommended practices of the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), and to harmonise the application of the ICAO airspace classification, with the aim to ensure the seamless provision of safe and efficient air traffic services within the single European sky.</para>
        <para>(2)Eurocontrol has been mandated in accordance with Article 8(1) of Regulation (EC) No 549/2004 of the European Parliament and the Council of 10 March2004 laying down the framework for the creation of the single European sky to assist the Commission in the development of implementing rules which lay down appropriate provisions on rules of the air based upon ICAO Standards and recommended practices, and harmonise the application of the ICAO airspace classification.</para>
        <para>(3)In accordance with Articles 1(3) and 13 of Regulation (EC) No 549/2004 and Article 2 of Regulation (EC) No 216/2008, the single European sky initiative should assist the Member States in fulfilling their obligations under the 1944 Chicago Convention on International Civil Aviation (hereafter the Chicago Convention) by providing for common interpretation and implementation.</para>
        <para>(4)The objective of Regulation (EC) No 551/2004 is to support the concept of a more integrated operating airspace within the context of the common transport policy, and to establish common procedures for design, planning and management while ensuring the efficient and safe performance of air traffic management. This objective is particularly relevant for the rapid implementation of functional airspace blocks in the single European sky.</para>
        <para>(5)The outcome of the work undertaken by the joint group created by the Commission, Eurocontrol and ICAO, which charted the national differences filed by Member States relating to ICAO Standards dealing with rules of the air and related provisions for air navigation services, supports the need for standardisation of common rules and differences with respect to the single European sky.</para>
        <para>(6)In order to ensure safe, efficient and expeditious international air traffic and to support the establishment of functional airspace blocks, all participants in the single European sky should adhere to a common set of rules. Furthermore, a key enabler of safe cross-border operations is the creation of a transparent regulatory system, where the actors can be provided a legal certainty and predictability. To this end, standardised rules of the air and related operational provisions regarding services and procedures in air navigation should be established, and be supplemented, where appropriate, with guidance material and/or acceptable means of compliance.</para>
        <para>(7)To achieve those objectives, only commonly agreed European differences should be notified to ICAO by the Member States on areas which are covered by Union law. Those differences should be established and monitored through a permanent process.</para>
        <para>(8)Member States that have adopted additional provisions complementing an ICAO standard, should, if they are still considered necessary and provided such additional provisions do not constitute a difference under the Chicago Convention or against existing Union law, continue to apply such provisions until they are addressed by appropriate Union provisions.</para>
        <para>(9)The application of this Regulation should be without prejudice to the Member States&#8217; obligations and rights over the high seas, in accordance with Article 12 of the Chicago Convention, and in particular with Annex 2 to the Chicago Convention, as well as the obligations of Member States and the Union under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and the obligations of Member States under the Convention on the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea, 1972.</para>

            <para>GM1 Article 2(90)&#160;Instrument approach procedure</para>
            <para>ED Decision 2016/023/R</para>
            <para>Instrument approach operations are classified based on the designed lowest operating minima below which an approach operation should only be continued with the required visual reference as follows:</para>
            <para>(a)Type A: a minimum descent height or decision height (DH) at or above 75&#160;m (250&#160;ft); and</para>
            <para>(b)Type B: a DH below 75&#160;m (250&#160;ft). Type B instrument approach operations are categorised as:</para>
            <para>(1)Category I (CAT I): a DH not lower than 60&#160;m (200&#160;ft) and with either a visibility not less than 800&#160;m or a runway visual range (RVR) not less than 550&#160;m;</para>
            <para>(2)Category II (CAT II): a DH lower than 60&#160;m (200&#160;ft) but not lower than 30&#160;m (100&#160;ft) and an RVR not less than 300&#160;m;</para>
            <para>(3)Category IIIA (CAT IIIA): a DH lower than 30&#160;m (100&#160;ft) or no DH and an RVR not less than 175&#160;m;</para>
            <para>(4)Category IIIB (CAT IIIB): a DH lower than 15&#160;m (50&#160;ft) or no DH and an RVR less than 175&#160;m but not less than 50&#160;m; and</para>
            <para>(5)Category IIIC (CAT IIIC): no DH and no RVR limitations.</para>
            <para>Where DH and RVR fall into different categories of operation, the instrument approach operation would be conducted in accordance with the requirements of the most demanding category (e.g. an operation with a DH in the range of CAT IIIA but with an RVR in the range of CAT IIIB would be considered a CAT IIIB operation, or an operation with a DH in the range of CAT II but with an RVR in the range of CAT I would be considered a CAT II operation).</para>
            <para>The required visual reference means that section of the visual aids or of the approach area which should have been in view for sufficient time for the pilot to have made an assessment of the aircraft position and rate of change of position, in relation to the desired flight path. In the case of a circling approach operation, the required visual reference is the runway environment.</para>

            <para>(a)The exemptions covered by Article 4 are intended for cases where the operation is of sufficient public interest to warrant allowing non-compliance with this Regulation, including the acceptance of the additional safety risks involved in such operations. Possible exemptions for normal operations, which are outside the scope of this Article, are covered by the specific provisions in the Annex (e.g. in provisions containing formulations such as &#8216;as permitted by the competent authority&#8217;, &#8216;unless otherwise specified by the competent authority&#8217;, etc.).</para>
            <para>(b)Depending on the case, the competent authority may decide to grant the exemption to individual flights, groups of flights, or types of operations performed by specified operators.</para>
            <para>(c)The exemptions may be granted either permanently, or as a temporary measure. Where the exemption is granted permanently, particular attention should be paid to ensuring that the conditions of the exemptions continue to be complied with over time.</para>
            <para>(d)As referred to in Article 4(3), and depending on national rules, some of these operations may be performed under the Operational Air Traffic (OAT) rules in certain Member States and, thus, are entirely outside the scope of this Regulation.</para>

              <para>(a)The aircraft that has the right-of-way shall maintain its heading and speed.</para>
              <para>(b)An aircraft that is aware that the manoeuvrability of another aircraft is impaired shall give way to that aircraft.</para>
              <para>(c)An aircraft that is obliged by the following rules to keep out of the way of another shall avoid passing over, under or in front of the other, unless it passes well clear and takes into account the effect of aircraft wake turbulence.</para>
              <para>(1)Approaching head-on. When two aircraft are approaching head-on or approximately so and there is danger of collision, each shall alter its heading to the right.</para>
              <para>(2)Converging. When two aircraft are converging at approximately the same level, the aircraft that has the other on its right shall give way, except as follows:</para>
              <para>(i)power-driven heavier-than-air aircraft shall give way to airships, sailplanes and balloons;</para>
              <para>(ii)airships shall give way to sailplanes and balloons;</para>

              <para>(iv)power-driven aircraft shall give way to aircraft which are seen to be towing other aircraft or objects.</para>
              <para>(3)Overtaking. An overtaking aircraft is an aircraft that approaches another from the rear on a line forming an angle of less than 70 degrees with the plane of symmetry of the latter, i.e. is in such a position with reference to the other aircraft that at night it should be unable to see either of the aircraft&#8217;s left (port) or right (starboard) navigation lights. An aircraft that is being overtaken has the right-of-way and the overtaking aircraft, whether climbing, descending or in horizontal flight, shall keep out of the way of the other aircraft by altering its heading to the right, and no subsequent change in the relative positions of the two aircraft shall absolve the overtaking aircraft from this obligation until it is entirely past and clear.</para>
              <para>(i)Sailplanes overtaking. A sailplane overtaking another sailplane may alter its course to the right or to the left.</para>
              <para>(4)Landing. An aircraft in flight, or operating on the ground or water, shall give way to aircraft landing or in the final stages of an approach to land.</para>
              <para>(i)When two or more heavier-than-air aircraft are approaching an aerodrome or an operating site for the purpose of landing, aircraft at the higher level shall give way to aircraft at the lower level, but the latter shall not take advantage of this rule to cut in front of another which is in the final stages of an approach to land, or to overtake that aircraft. Nevertheless, power-driven heavier-than-air aircraft shall give way to sailplanes.</para>
              <para>(ii)Emergency landing. An aircraft that is aware that another is compelled to land shall give way to that aircraft.</para>
              <para>(5)Taking off. An aircraft taxiing on the manoeuvring area of an aerodrome shall give way to aircraft taking off or about to take off.</para>
              <para>(d)Surface movement of aircraft, persons and vehicles.</para>
              <para>(1)In case of danger of collision between two aircraft taxiing on the movement area of an aerodrome or equivalent part of an operating site, the following shall apply:</para>
              <para>(i)when two aircraft are approaching head on, or approximately so, each shall stop or where practicable alter its course to the right so as to keep well clear;</para>
              <para>(ii)when two aircraft are on a converging course, the one which has the other on its right shall give way;</para>
              <para>(iii)an aircraft which is being overtaken by another aircraft shall have the right-of-way and the overtaking aircraft shall keep well clear of the other aircraft.</para>
              <para>(2)At a controlled aerodrome an aircraft taxiing on the manoeuvring area shall stop and hold at all runway-holding positions unless an explicit clearance to enter or cross the runway has been issued by the aerodrome control tower.</para>
              <para>(3)An aircraft taxiing on the manoeuvring area shall stop and hold at all lighted stop bars and may proceed further in accordance with (2) when the lights are switched off.</para>
              <para>(4)Movement of persons and vehicles at aerodromes:</para>
              <para>(i)The movement of persons or vehicles, including towed aircraft, on the manoeuvring area of an aerodrome shall be controlled by the aerodrome control tower as necessary to avoid hazard to them or to aircraft landing, taxiing or taking off.</para>
              <para>(ii)In conditions where low visibility procedures are in operation:</para>
              <para>(A)persons and vehicles operating on the manoeuvring area of an aerodrome shall be restricted to the essential minimum and particular regard shall be given to the requirements to protect the critical and sensitive area(s) of radio navigation aids;</para>
              <para>(B)subject to the provisions of point (iii), the method or methods to separate vehicles and taxiing aircraft shall be as specified by the air navigation service provider (&#8216;ANSP&#8217;) and approved by the competent authority taking into account the aids available;</para>
              <para>(C)when mixed ILS and MLS Category II or Category III precision instrument operations are taking place to the same runway continuously, the more restrictive ILS or MLS critical and sensitive areas shall be protected.</para>
              <para>(iii)Emergency vehicles proceeding to the assistance of an aircraft in distress shall be afforded priority over all other surface movement traffic.</para>
              <para>(iv)Subject to the provisions in (iii), vehicles on the manoeuvring area shall be required to comply with the following rules:</para>
              <para>(A)vehicles and vehicles towing aircraft shall give way to aircraft which are landing, taking-off or taxiing;</para>
              <para>(B)vehicles shall give way to other vehicles towing aircraft;</para>
              <para>(C)vehicles shall give way to other vehicles in accordance with air traffic services unit instructions;</para>
              <para>(D)notwithstanding the provisions of (A), (B) and (C), vehicles and vehicles towing aircraft shall comply with instructions issued by the aerodrome control tower.</para>

The declaration should be supported by technical documentation showing compliance. Alternatively, the manufacturer may voluntarily ask for a technical evaluation of its system by a competent authority. Such declarations of conformity and technical evaluations may be used by aircraft operators to demonstrate to competent authorities compliance with point SERA.6005(c).</para>
              <para>NON-INSTALLED EQUIPMENT</para>
              <para>(d)The carriage of non-installed equipment on board the aircraft, for which EASA is the competent authority for the aircraft design, should comply with the applicable air operations requirements (points CAT.GEN.MPA.140, NCC.GEN.130, NCO.GEN.125, and SPO.GEN.130). The carriage of non-installed equipment on board the aircraft, for which an aviation competent authority is the authority for the aircraft design, should comply with the applicable air operations requirements defined by the relevant authorities. Aviation competent authorities may make use of the relevant EASA requirements for similar kinds of air operations with aircraft specified in Annex I to Regulation (EU) 2018/1139.</para>
              <para>(e)The equipment should be set up on board the aircraft in such a way so as to limit transmission obscuration by the airframe, human body, or other structures and at the same time maximise the visibility of the transmitting antennas, including those on the ground.</para>
              <para>MOBILE TELECOMMUNICATION SERVICES FOR AERIAL USE</para>
              <para>(f)National and international roaming agreements rely on standardised roamed services (SMS, voice streaming, etc.), which cannot be automatically presumed for aerial services. Only the mobile telecommunication services concluded by the standardisation bodies for aerial use could be used by manned aircraft to make themselves electronically conspicuous to U-space service providers.</para>
              <para>(g)There are country-specific restrictions for the aerial use of certain mobile telecommunication frequencies. Therefore, the frequencies used by aerial mobile telecommunication services should be consistent with the relevant decisions of the Electronic Communication Committee (ECC) of the European Conference of Postal and Telecommunications Administrations (CEPT) as implemented by national telecommunication authorities.</para>
              <para>MILITARY AND STATE AIRCRAFT OPERATIONS</para>
              <para>(h)Although the amendment to Implementing Regulation (EU) No 923/2012 introduced by Implementing Regulation (EU) 2021/666 does not apply to military and State aircraft operations and training, these aircraft may fully or partially operate in the U-space airspace. Military and State organisations may reserve the right not to be electronically conspicuous to U-space service providers, taking both security and safety requirements into account.</para>
              <para>(i)At national level, coordination between authorities in charge of civil and military/State aircraft should assess the risk of electronically non-conspicuous military and State aircraft operating in U-space airspace and may specify means by which the presence and or location of such aircraft may be communicated by the relevant operational units.</para>
              <para>(j)In determining the designation of an area as U-space airspace, States should consider operations and training conducted with manned military and State aircraft in the airspace concerned and the ability or otherwise to be conspicuous, whether for technical or operational reasons.</para>
              <para>SAFEGUARDS FOR CONTINUOUS TRANSMISSION</para>
              <para>(k)U-space service providersmay use the provisions of Article 18(h) of Implementing Regulation (EU) 2021/664 to inform the competent authority about any known irregularities in the continuous transmission of the systems that make manned aircraft electronically conspicuous to U-space service providers, particularly if such irregularities may negatively affect the provision of air traffic information services as referred to in Article 11 of that Regulation.</para>
              <para>(l)Manned aircraft that operate in U-space airspace should use the provisions of Regulation (EU) No&#160;376/2014 for reporting any known irregularities in the continuous transmission of the systems used for making them electronically conspicuous to U-space service providers.</para>
              <para>(m)The competent authority should, in case of an urgent safety problem, determine a corrective action (including directives or recommendations) to be taken by a natural or a legal person, where this is necessary to safeguard the safety of traffic information service.</para>

              <para>(a)The provision of vertical or horizontal separation by an air traffic control unit is not applicable in respect of any specified portion of a flight cleared subject to maintaining own separation and remaining in visual meteorological conditions.

              <para>(b)It is axiomatic that a VFR flight must remain in visual meteorological conditions at all times. Accordingly, the issuance of a clearance to a VFR flight to fly subject to maintaining own separation and remaining in visual meteorological conditions has no other object than to signify that, for the duration of the clearance, separation from other aircraft by air traffic control units is not provided.</para>
              <para>(c)The objectives of the air traffic control service as prescribed in ATS.TR.100 of Regulation (EU)&#160;2017/373 do not include prevention of collision with terrain.

When vectoring or assigning a direct routing not included in the flight plan, which takes an IFR flight off published ATS route or instrument procedure, the procedures in ATS.TR.235(a)(5) of Regulation (EU) 2017/373 apply.</para>

              <para>(a)If an aircraft cannot meet the requirements due to a failure or degradation of the RNAV system that is detected before departure from an aerodrome where it is not practicable to effect a repair, the aircraft concerned should be permitted to proceed to the nearest suitable aerodrome where the repair can be made. When granting clearance to such aircraft, ATC should take into consideration the existing or anticipated traffic situation and may have to modify the time of departure, flight level or route of the intended flight. Subsequent adjustments may become necessary during the course of the flight.</para>
              <para>With respect to the degradation/failure in flight of an RNAV system, while the aircraft is operating on an ATS route requiring the use of RNAV 5:</para>

              <para>(2)if no such routes are available, aircraft should be routed via conventional navigation aids, i.e. VOR/DME; or</para>
              <para>When the above procedures are not feasible, the ATC unit should, where practicable, provide the aircraft with radar vectors until the aircraft is capable of resuming its own navigation.</para>

              <para>(1)the aircraft should be provided with radar vectors until the aircraft is capable of resuming its own navigation; or</para>
              <para>(2)the aircraft should be routed by conventional navigation aids, i.e. VOR/DME.</para>
              <para>Subsequent ATC action in respect of an aircraft that cannot meet the specified requirements due to a failure or degradation of the RNAV system, will be dependent upon the nature of the reported failure and the overall traffic situation. Continued operation in accordance with the current ATC clearance may be possible in many situations. When this cannot be achieved, a revised clearance may be required to revert to VOR/DME navigation.</para>

              <para>Unless informed by the pilot, ATC does not know when ACAS issues RAs. It is possible for ATC to issue instructions that are unknowingly contrary to ACAS RA indications. Therefore, it is important that ATC be notified when an ATC instruction or clearance is not being followed because it conflicts with an RA.</para>

              <para>1. General</para>
              <para>1.1 Interception of civil aircraft should be avoided and should be undertaken only as a last resort. If undertaken, the interception should be limited to determining the identity of the aircraft, unless it is necessary to return the aircraft to its planned track, direct it beyond the boundaries of national airspace, guide it away from a prohibited, restricted or danger area or instruct it to effect a landing at a designated aerodrome. Practice interception of civil aircraft is not to be undertaken unless prior agreement has been reached to conduct such activity with the pilot and operator of the civil aircraft concerned.</para>
              <para>1.2 To eliminate or reduce the need for interception of civil aircraft, it is important that:</para>
              <para>(a)all possible efforts be made by intercept control units to secure identification of any aircraft which may be a civil aircraft, and to issue any necessary instructions or advice to such aircraft, through the appropriate ATS units. To this end, it is essential that means of rapid and reliable communications between intercept control units and ATS units be established and that agreements be formulated concerning exchanges of information between such units on the movements of civil aircraft, in accordance with the provisions of SERA.4001(b)(4), SERA.11010(a)(1)(iv), SERA.11010(a)(3)(ii), SERA.11010(b), and SERA.11010(b)(5);</para>
              <para>(b)areas prohibited to all civil flights and areas in which civil flight is not permitted without special authorisation by the State be clearly promulgated in the AIP together with the risk, if any, of interception in the event of penetration of such areas. When delineating such areas in close proximity to promulgated ATS routes, or other frequently used tracks, account should be taken of the availability and overall systems accuracy of the navigation systems to be used by civil aircraft and their ability to remain clear of the delineated areas;</para>
              <para>(c)the establishment of additional navigation aids be considered where necessary to ensure that civil aircraft are able to safely circumnavigate prohibited or, as required, restricted areas.</para>
              <para>1.3 To eliminate or reduce the hazards inherent in interceptions undertaken as a last resort, all possible efforts should be made to ensure coordinated actions by the pilots and ground units concerned. To this end, it is essential that steps be taken to ensure that:</para>
              <para>(a)all pilots of civil aircraft are made fully aware of the actions to be taken by them and the visual signals to be used;</para>
              <para>(b)operators or pilots-in-command of civil aircraft implement the capability of aircraft to communicate on 121,5&#160;MHz and the availability of interception procedures and visual signals on board aircraft,</para>
              <para>(c)all ATS personnel are made fully aware of the actions to be taken by them in accordance with the provisions of SERA.4001(b)(4), SERA.11010(a)(1)(iv), SERA.11010(a)(3)(ii), SERA.11010(b)and SERA.11010(b)(5);</para>
              <para>(d)all pilots-in-command of intercepting aircraft are made aware of the general performance limitations of civil aircraft and of the possibility that intercepted civil aircraft may be in a state of emergency due to technical difficulties or unlawful interference;</para>
              <para>(e)clear and unambiguous instructions are issued to intercept control units and to pilots-in-command of potential intercepting aircraft, covering interception manoeuvres, guidance of intercepted aircraft, action by intercepted aircraft, air-to-air visual signals, radio-communication with intercepted aircraft, and the need to refrain from resorting to the use of weapons;</para>
              <para>Note. See paragraphs 2 to 6.</para>
              <para>(f)intercept control units and intercepting aircraft are provided with radiotelephony equipment so as to enable them to communicate with intercepted aircraft on the emergency frequency 121,5&#160;MHz,</para>
              <para>(g)secondary surveillance radar and/or ADS-B facilities are made available to the extent possible to permit intercept control units to identify civil aircraft in areas where they might otherwise be intercepted. Such facilities should permit recognition of aircraft identity and immediate recognition of any emergency or urgency conditions.</para>
              <para>2. Interception manoeuvres</para>
              <para>2.1 A standard method should be established for the manoeuvring of aircraft intercepting a civil aircraft in order to avoid any hazard for the intercepted aircraft. Such method should take due account of the performance limitations of civil aircraft, the need to avoid flying in such proximity to the intercepted aircraft that a collision hazard may be created, and the need to avoid crossing the aircraft&#8217;s flight path or to perform any other manoeuvre in such a manner that the wake turbulence may be hazardous, particularly if the intercepted aircraft is a light aircraft.</para>
              <para>2.2 An aircraft equipped with an ACAS, which is being intercepted, may perceive the interceptor as a collision threat and thus initiate an avoidance manoeuvre in response to an ACAS RA. Such a manoeuvre might be misinterpreted by the interceptor as an indication of unfriendly intentions. It is important therefore that pilots of intercepting aircraft equipped with a secondary surveillance radar (SSR) transponder suppress the transmission of pressure-altitude information (in Mode C replies or in the AC field of Mode S replies) within a range of at least 37&#160;km (20&#160;NM) of the aircraft being intercepted. This prevents the ACAS in the intercepted aircraft from using RAs in respect of the interceptor, while the ACAS traffic advisory information will remain available.</para>
              <para>2.3 Manoeuvres for visual identification</para>
              <para>The following method is recommended for the manoeuvring of intercepting aircraft for the purpose of visually identifying a civil aircraft:</para>
              <para>Phase I</para>
              <para>The intercepting aircraft should approach the intercepted aircraft from astern. The element leader, or the single intercepting aircraft, should normally take up a position on the left (port) side, slightly above and ahead of the intercepted aircraft, within the field of view of the pilot of the intercepted aircraft, and initially not closer to the aircraft than 300&#160;m. Any other participating aircraft should stay well clear of the intercepted aircraft, preferably above and behind. After speed and position have been established, the aircraft should, if necessary, proceed with Phase II of the procedure.</para>
              <para>Phase II</para>
              <para>The element leader, or the single intercepting aircraft, should begin closing in gently on the intercepted aircraft, at the same level, until no closer than absolutely necessary to obtain the information needed. The element leader, or the single intercepting aircraft, should use caution to avoid startling the flight crew or the passengers of the intercepted aircraft, keeping constantly in mind the fact that manoeuvres considered normal to an intercepting aircraft may be considered hazardous to passengers and crews of civil aircraft. Any other participating aircraft should continue to stay well clear of the intercepted aircraft. Upon completion of identification, the intercepting aircraft should withdraw from the vicinity of the intercepted aircraft as outlined in Phase III.</para>
              <para>Phase III</para>
              <para>The element leader, or the single intercepting aircraft, should break gently away from the intercepted aircraft in a shallow dive. Any other participating aircraft should stay well clear of the intercepted aircraft and re-join their leader.</para>
              <para>2.4 Manoeuvres for navigational guidance</para>
              <para>2.4.1 If, following the identification manoeuvres in Phase I and Phase II above, it is considered necessary to intervene in the navigation of the intercepted aircraft, the element leader, or the single intercepting aircraft, should normally take up a position on the left (port) side, slightly above and ahead of the intercepted aircraft, to enable the pilot-in-command of the latter aircraft to see the visual signals given.</para>
              <para>2.4.2 It is indispensable that the pilot-in-command of the intercepting aircraft be satisfied that the pilot-in-command of the intercepted aircraft is aware of the interception and acknowledges the signals given. If repeated attempts to attract the attention of the pilot-in-command of the intercepted aircraft by use of the Series 1 signal in Table S11-1, are unsuccessful, other methods of signalling may be used for this purpose, including as a last resort the visual effect of the reheat/afterburner, provided that no hazard is created for the intercepted aircraft.</para>
              <para>2.5 It is recognised that meteorological conditions or terrain may occasionally make it necessary for the element leader, or the single intercepting aircraft, to take up a position on the right (starboard) side, slightly above and ahead of the intercepted aircraft. In such case, the pilot-in-command of the intercepting aircraft must take particular care that the intercepting aircraft is clearly visible at all times to the pilot-in-command of the intercepted aircraft.</para>
              <para>3. Guidance of an intercepted aircraft</para>
              <para>3.1 Navigational guidance and related information should be given to an intercepted aircraft by radiotelephony, whenever radio contact can be established.</para>
              <para>3.2 When navigational guidance is given to an intercepted aircraft, care must be taken that the aircraft is not led into conditions where the visibility may be reduced below that required to maintain flight in visual meteorological conditions and that the manoeuvres demanded of the intercepted aircraft do not add to already existing hazards in the event that the operating efficiency of the aircraft is impaired.</para>
              <para>3.3 In the exceptional case where an intercepted civil aircraft is required to land in the territory overflown, care must also be taken that:</para>
              <para>(a)the designated aerodrome is suitable for the safe landing of the aircraft type concerned, especially if the aerodrome is not normally used for civil air transport operations;</para>
              <para>(b)the surrounding terrain is suitable for circling, approach and missed approach manoeuvres;</para>
              <para>(c)the intercepted aircraft has sufficient fuel remaining to reach the aerodrome;</para>
              <para>(d)if the intercepted aircraft is a civil transport aircraft, the designated aerodrome has a runway with a length equivalent to at least 2&#160;500&#160;m at MSL and a bearing strength sufficient to support the aircraft; and</para>
              <para>(e)whenever possible, the designated aerodrome is one that is described in detail in the relevant AIP.</para>
              <para>3.4 When requiring a civil aircraft to land at an unfamiliar aerodrome, it is essential that sufficient time be allowed for it to prepare for a landing, bearing in mind that only the pilot-in-command of the civil aircraft can judge the safety of the landing operation in relation to runway length and aircraft mass at the time.</para>
              <para>3.5 It is particularly important that all information necessary to facilitate a safe approach and landing be given to the intercepted aircraft by radiotelephony.</para>
              <para>4. Air-to-air visual signals</para>
              <para>The visual signals to be used by intercepting and intercepted aircraft are those set forth in Tables S11-1 and S11-2. It is essential that intercepting and intercepted aircraft adhere strictly to those signals and interpret correctly the signals given by the other aircraft, and that the intercepting aircraft pay particular attention to any signals given by the intercepted aircraft to indicate that it is in a state of distress or urgency.</para>
              <para>5. Radio communication between the intercept control unit or the intercepting aircraft and the intercepted aircraft</para>
              <para>5.1 When an interception is being made, the intercept control unit and the intercepting aircraft should:</para>
              <para>(a)first attempt to establish two-way communication with the intercepted aircraft in a common language on the emergency frequency 121,5&#160;MHz, using the call signs &#8216;INTERCEPT CONTROL&#8217;, &#8216;INTERCEPTOR (call sign)&#8217; and &#8216;INTERCEPTED AIRCRAFT&#8217; respectively, and</para>
              <para>(b)failing this, attempt to establish two-way communication with the intercepted aircraft on such other frequency or frequencies as may have been prescribed by the competent authority, or to establish contact through the appropriate ATS unit(s).</para>
              <para>5.2 If radio contact is established during interception, but communication in a common language is not possible, attempts must be made to convey instructions, acknowledgement of instructions and essential information by using the phrases and pronunciations in Table S11-3 and transmitting each phrase twice.</para>
              <para>6. Refraining from the use of weapons</para>
              <para>The use of tracer bullets to attract attention is hazardous, and it is expected that measures will be taken to avoid their use so that the lives of persons on board and the safety of aircraft will not be endangered.</para>
              <para>7. Coordination between intercept control units and ATS units</para>
              <para>It is essential that close coordination be maintained between an intercept control unit and the appropriate ATS unit during all phases of an interception of an aircraft which is, or might be, a civil aircraft, in order for the ATS unit to be kept fully informed of the developments and of the action required of the intercepted aircraft.</para>

              <para>When an aircraft experiencing transponder failure after departure is operating or expected to operate in an area where the carriage of a functioning transponder with specified capabilities is mandatory, the ATC units concerned should endeavour to provide for continuation of the flight to the aerodrome of first intended landing in accordance with the flight plan. However, in certain traffic situations, either in terminal areas or en-route, continuation of the flight may not be possible, particularly when failure is detected shortly after take-off. The aircraft may then be required to return to the departure aerodrome or to land at the nearest suitable aerodrome acceptable to the operator concerned and to ATC.</para>

              <para>TRANSPONDER FAILURE BEFORE DEPARTURE</para>
              <para>In case of a transponder failure which is detected before departure from an aerodrome where it is not practicable to effect a repair, the aircraft concerned should be permitted to proceed, as directly as possible, to the nearest suitable aerodrome where repair can be made. When granting clearance to such aircraft, ATC should take into consideration the existing or anticipated traffic situation and may have to modify the time of departure, flight level or route of the intended flight. Subsequent adjustments may become necessary during the course of the flight. Note that Article 4(4) of Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 1207/2011 also addresses this issue.</para>

              <para>The competent authority should only prescribe other conditions for the use of English language at aerodromes with more than 50&#160;000 international IFR movements per year for specific cases, based on an individual assessment of the local arrangements. In any case, deviation from the requirement should be limited to exceptional cases and should be accompanied with a safety assessment.</para>
              <para>In States which decide not to apply the requirement to use the English language, the study referred to in SERA.14015 should include an independent and comprehensive assessment of the impact of not using English for air-ground radio communications. Such an assessment should in particular take into account:</para>
              <para>(a)Any available accident and incident investigation reports at least at EU level, where the use of language has been identified as a contributing factor. For this purpose, the central repository created in accordance with Commission Regulations (EC) Nos1321/2007 and 996/2010 for such reports should also be consulted.</para>
              <para>(b)The proportion of pilots frequenting that airport,&#160;with English language proficiency endorsement.</para>
              <para>(c)The proportion of pilots frequenting that airport, lacking language proficiency endorsement in the alternative language to be used.</para>
              <para>(d)A consultation of flight crews operating at the airport in question, on their preferences and ability to use the languages in question.</para>
              <para>(e)A consultation of the safety investigation authority.</para>

              <para>In addition to the requirement in SERA.14015, positive consideration should be given by competent authorities to the benefits of situational awareness which could improve safety on airports and relevant surrounding airspace sectors by extending the use of the English language on some safety critical frequencies at aerodromes and relevant surrounding airspace sectors also with less than 50&#160;000 commercial IFR movements per year, but with international traffic, and a large majority of qualified pilots with acceptable level of English. This consideration would in particular encompass:</para>
              <para>(a)use of a single frequency for all the safety-critical operations on a runway or a set of runways;</para>
              <para>(b)the need to and feasibility of applying the requirement for English-only communications also to communications with vehicles in order to enhance situational awareness; and</para>
              <para>(c)where this consideration could lead to a change in current communication arrangements, it should be based on the outcome of a local safety assessment.</para>

An aircraft shall use its abbreviated call sign only after it has been addressed in this manner by the aeronautical station.</para>
            <para>(2)When issuing ATC clearances and reading back such clearances, controllers and pilots shall always add the call sign of the aircraft to which the clearance applies. For other than those occasions, continuous two-way communication after contact has been established shall be permitted without further identification or call until termination of the contact.</para>

              <para>SUPER-PRESSURE BALLOONS</para>
              <para>Super-pressure balloons do not require flight termination devices as they quickly rise after payload discharge and burst without the need for a device or system designed to puncture the balloon envelope. In this context a super-pressure balloon is a simple non-extensible envelope capable of withstanding a differential of pressure, higher inside than out. It is inflated so that the smaller night-time pressure of the gas still fully extends the envelope. Such a super-pressure balloon will keep essentially constant level until too much gas diffuses out of it.</para>
