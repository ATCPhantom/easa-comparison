        <para>This document is issued by the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (referred to as both &#8216;EASA&#8217; and &#8216;the Agency&#8217;) to provide its stakeholders with an updated, consolidated, and easy-to-read publication. It has been prepared by putting together the officially published EU regulations with the related EASA acceptable means of compliance (AMC) and guidance material (GM) (including their amendments) adopted so far. However, this is not an official publication, and EASA accepts no liability for damage of any kind resulting from the risks inherent in its use.</para>

        <para>Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 216/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20&#160;February&#160;2008 on common rules in the field of civil aviation and establishing a European Aviation Safety Agency, and repealing Council Directive 91/670/EEC, Regulation (EC) No 1592/2002 and Directive 2004/36/EC, and in particular Article 8b(6) thereof,</para>
        <para>Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 550/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 10&#160;March&#160;2004 on the provision of air navigation services in the single European sky (the service provision Regulation), and in particular Articles 4 and 6 thereof,</para>
        <para>Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 551/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 10&#160;March&#160;2004 on&#160;the organisation and use of the airspace in the single European sky (the airspace Regulation), and in particular Article 6(7) thereof,</para>
        <para>Whereas:</para>
        <para>(1)Commission Implementing Regulations (EU) No 1034/2011 and (EU) No 1035/2011 lay down requirements on safety oversight in air traffic management and air navigation services and common requirements for the provision of air navigation services, respectively. Those latter requirements are to be complied with by the service providers concerned in order for them to be issued the certificates referred to in Article&#160;7(1) of Regulation (EC) No 550/2004 and Article&#160;8b(2) of Regulation (EC) No 216/2008. Those Regulations also lay down requirements concerning the competent authorities, which are responsible for issuing those certificates and exercising oversight and enforcement tasks, in accordance with Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 549/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council, Articles 2 and 7(7) of Regulation (EC) No 550/2004 and Articles 10 and 22a of Regulation (EC) No 216/2008.</para>
        <para>(2)The requirements set out in Implementing Regulations (EU) No 1034/2011 and (EU) No 1035/2011 serve in particular to implement, at an initial stage, the essential requirements concerning the provision of air traffic management and air navigation services (&#8216;ATM/ANS&#8217;) set out in Regulation (EC) No 216/2008, in particular to ensure compliance with Articles 8b and 22a of Regulation (EC) No 216/2008 and Annex Vb thereto and to allow the commencement of standardisation inspections in accordance with Article 24 of Regulation (EC) No 216/2008.</para>
        <para>(3)Those requirements set out in Implementing Regulations (EU) No 1034/2011 and (EU) No 1035/2011 should now be complemented and updated, in light of technical progress. It should also be clarified that, for service providers to be issued and retain a certificate, or to make a declaration, in accordance with this Regulation, they must comply, and continue to comply, with those requirements as well as with the essential requirements referred to in Article&#160;8b(1) of Regulation (EC) No 216/2008. In addition, consistency should be ensured between those requirements and the requirements set out in Commission Regulations (EU) No 965/2012, (EU) No 1178/2011,(EU) No 139/2014 and (EU) 2015/340, thus moving towards a &#8216;total system approach&#8217;, which entails a logical and technologically consistent approach across the various domains. Therefore, the requirements set out in Implementing Regulations&#160;(EU) No 1034/2011 and (EU) No 1035/2011 should now be laid down in a single instrument and Implementing Regulations (EU) No 1034/2011 and (EU) No 1035/2011 should be repealed.</para>
        <para>(4)Common rules for the certification and oversight of the service providers concerned are essential to increase the Member States' confidence in each other's systems. Therefore, and in order to ensure the highest level of safety and security, uniform requirements for the provision of services and their oversight should be strengthened. That should ensure the safe, high-quality provision of services for the purpose of air navigation and the mutual recognition of certificates throughout the Union, thereby increasing freedom of movement and improving the availability of those services.</para>
        <para>(5)In order to ensure a harmonised approach to certification and oversight, the measures to be implemented for security of systems, constituents in use and data should be coordinated across Member States, functional airspace blocks and the network formed by the services, functions and products offered by service providers, the Network Manager, aerodromes and other persons providing the necessary infrastructure for flight operations.</para>
        <para>(6)Safety management ensures the identification, assessment and minimisation of safety risks as well as security vulnerabilities which have an impact on safety. Therefore, it is necessary to further elaborate the requirements related to the safety assessment of changes to the functional system by a certified organisation. Those requirements should be adapted taking into account the integration of requirements relating to change management into the common regulatory structure for civil aviation safety, as well as the experience gained by stakeholders and competent authorities in the field of safety oversight.</para>
        <para>(7)It is appropriate to introduce safety culture as an aspect of the management systems of the service providers in a manner that promotes understanding and improvement of those systems, while acknowledging the need to strengthen management systems further, especially by integrating reliable occurrence reporting.</para>
        <para>(8)It should be specified which authorities are responsible for the tasks related to certification, oversight and enforcement in respect of the service providers that are subject to this Regulation, in line with the criterion set out in Article 7(2) of Regulation (EC) No 550/2004 and the tasks of the European Aviation Safety Agency (&#8216;the Agency&#8217;) pursuant to Article 22a of Regulation (EC) No 216/2008, and without prejudice to the requirements of Article 2 of Regulation (EC) No 550/2004. The Agency should be the competent authority for providers of data services and for the Network Manager, in light of the nature and scale of the services provided. In order to fulfil the objectives of Regulation (EC) No 216/2008, in particular the objective set out in point (d) of Article 2(2) thereof, and the objective set out in Article 1(3) of Regulation (EC) No 549/2004, it is also appropriate to align the requirements for the competent authorities with the progress in International Civil Aviation Organisation (&#8216;ICAO&#8217;) safety management concepts, in particular the introduction of the authority management system, as well as in the implementation of the state safety programme and in ensuring coordination between those authorities.</para>
        <para>(9)It should be clarified that, when exercising their certification, oversight and enforcement tasks under this Regulation, the competent authorities should be independent from any service provider, through ensuring adequate separation of those authorities from those providers at least at the functional level, and that any possible conflict of interest should be avoided. The aim is to guarantee the objectivity and impartiality of those authorities and to ensure that the exercise of their tasks under this Regulation is of high quality.</para>
        <para>(10)The Agency should establish a database with relevant information relating to the competent authorities, so as to facilitate standardisation inspections of, and coordination with, the competent authorities, as well as to support the Commission in carrying out its tasks.</para>
        <para>(11)With a view to ensuring that the requirements for service providers set out in this Regulation are complied with&#160;at all times and the competent authorities can effectively exercise their tasks under this Regulation, in accordance&#160;with Article 4(3) and (4) of Regulation (EC) No 549/2004, those authorities should be granted certain specific&#160;investigatory powers, in addition to the possibility to carry out investigations and surveys referred to in Article 2(2) of Regulation (EC) No 550/2004 and Article 10(2) and (3) of Regulation (EC) No 216/2008. It is appropriate to clarify that those powers should be exercised in accordance with the applicable rules of national law, while having due regard to a number of specific elements, which are meant to ensure a fair balance between all rights and interests at issue in a particular case.</para>
        <para>(12)The air traffic safety electronics personnel employed by a service provider or the Network Manager should be subject to a harmonised training and competence assessment scheme. The service provider or Network Manager should also ensure that the personnel of contracted organisations are appropriately qualified. Therefore, detailed provisions on training and competence assessment of such personnel should be included in this Regulation.</para>
        <para>(13)In order to ensure a high level of civil aviation safety in the Union, the measures set out in this Regulation should reflect the state of the art in aviation safety, including best practice and scientific and technical progress in the field of meteorological services. Therefore, this Regulation should be based on the applicable ICAO standards and recommended practices, specifically Annex 3 to the Convention on International Aviation, signed in Chicago on 7&#160;December&#160;1944 (&#8216;Chicago Convention&#8217;) on &#8216;Meteorological Service for International Air Navigation&#8217;, while drawing on the experience of Union and worldwide meteorological service provision and ensuring proportionality according to the size, type and complexity of the meteorological services provider.</para>
        <para>(14)Common requirements should be established for the certification and oversight of data services providers to ensure that the providers of aeronautical data for use on aircraft process the data in an appropriate manner, which meets the airspace end-users' requirements and allows for safe performance-based navigation operations.</para>
        <para>(15)The aeronautical industry and the competent authorities of the Member States should be allowed sufficient time to adapt to the new regulatory framework established by this Regulation and to replace certificates issued before the date of application of this Regulation.</para>
        <para>(16)However, in order to ensure consistency with Regulation (EU) No 965/2012, the relevant provisions of this Regulation should apply to data services providers already from an earlier date. Moreover, those providers should be allowed, on a voluntary basis, to apply for, and be granted, the relevant certificates already immediately upon the entry into force of this Regulation, so as to allow them, as entities that are not subject to Implementing Regulation (EU) No 1035/2011 but that are subject to the practice of issuing voluntary letters of acceptance by the Agency, to benefit from an early application of this Regulation in this regard and the mutual recognition of those certificates. Such early application of this Regulation with respect to data services providers would also relieve aircraft operators from their oversight responsibilities when contracting the services of those providers, once the provider is certified for aeronautical databases. Where such a provider makes use of that possibility, it should be bound by the applicable requirements of this Regulation for the purposes of obtaining a certificate and subsequently continue to be bound by those requirements. In view of this possibility for data service providers, the relevant provisions of this Regulation concerning the competent authority in respect of those providers, which is in this case only the Agency, should also apply already from the date of entry into force of this Regulation.</para>
        <para>(17)The provisions contained in Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 923/2012 should be complemented with aspects related to the provision of air traffic services, to ensure consistency of service provision with pilot and air traffic service personnel actions and requirements under that Regulation.</para>
        <para>(18)The safety acceptability of any change proposed by a service provider should be assessed based on the analysis of the risks posed by the introduction of a change to its functional system, differentiated under either quantitative or qualitative objective assessment criteria, or a combination of both, to be determined at a local level.</para>
        <para>(19)For reasons of consistency and ease of application, the provisions of Commission Regulation (EC) No 482/2008 should be integrated in this Regulation and Commission Regulation (EC) No&#160;482/2008 should therefore be repealed.</para>
        <para>(20)The requirements of Articles 12 and 21 of Commission Regulation (EU) No&#160;677/2011 and Annex&#160;VI thereto should be integrated in this Regulation in order to ensure a harmonised approach to all service providers. Therefore, those provisions should be deleted.</para>
        <para>(21)Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2016/1377, which has not yet become applicable, contains numerous errors. In order to eliminate those errors, while at the same time ensuring the required legal clarity, it is appropriate to repeal Implementing Regulation (EU) 2016/1377 in its entirety and to replace it with the rules set out in this Regulation.</para>
        <para>(22)The measures provided for in this Regulation are based on the opinion of the Agency in accordance with Articles 17(2)(b) and 19(1) of Regulation (EC) No 216/2008.</para>
        <para>(23)The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee established by Article 5(3) of Regulation (EC) No 549/2004,</para>

            <para>(a)The airspace where air traffic services are provided is classified and designated in accordance with requirements found in Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 923/2012, SERA.6001 &#8216;Classification of airspaces&#8217; and Appendix 4 &#8216;ATS airspace classes &#8212; services provided and flight requirements&#8217;, and in the associated Acceptable Means of Compliance and Guidance Material.</para>
            <para>(b)The delineation of airspace, wherein air traffic services are to be provided, should be related to the nature of the route structure and the need for efficient service rather than to national boundaries.</para>
            <para>(c)In the context of the provision of air traffic services across national boundaries:</para>
            <para>(1)agreements to permit the delineation of airspace lying across national boundaries are advisable, when such action will facilitate the provision of air traffic services; agreements, which permit delineation of airspace boundaries by straight lines, will, for example, be most convenient where data processing techniques are used by air traffic services units.</para>
            <para>(2)where delineation of airspace is made by reference to national boundaries, there is a need for suitably sited transfer points to be mutually agreed upon.</para>

            <para>(a)a mixture of different types of air traffic with aircraft of varying speeds (conventional, jet, etc.) might necessitate the air traffic services provision, whereas a relatively greater density of traffic where only one type of operation is involved would not;</para>

            <para>(c)open stretches of water, mountainous, uninhabited or desert areas might necessitate the air traffic services provision even though the frequency of operations is extremely low;</para>

            <para>AUTHORISED PERSONNEL</para>
            <para>(a)The achievement of competence is independent of the permission to perform any task. Therefore, the ATSEP should be authorised to work on operational systems.</para>
            <para>(b)It is intentionally not specified who is responsible for providing this authorisation. This is usually done by the service provider, but it might be done by another entity depending on the national arrangements for managing the competence and performance of ATSEP.</para>
            <para>OPERATE, MAINTAIN, RELEASE FROM, AND RETURN INTO OPERATIONS</para>
            <para>(c)The term &#8216;operate&#8217; refers to the ability of the ATSEP to actively control a system and should not be confused with, for example, the air traffic controllers&#8217; function to operate particular equipment in order to provide air traffic services. However, it is necessary for ATSEP to have an understanding of how air traffic controllers operate or make use of operational systems, in order to repair and maintain them appropriately. An ATSEP usually manages the engineering operation of operational systems, for example&#160;by:</para>
            <para>(1)making a radiotelephony test transmission to check a voice communication and control system or a recording system;</para>
            <para>(2)switching between systems&#160;A&#160;and&#160;B, or switching off the stand-by system, in case of duplicated systems; or</para>
            <para>(3)changing the range and gating maps of a radar system processor.</para>
            <para>(d)The term &#8216;maintain&#8217; refers to planned, preventative and corrective maintenance, including fault-finding.</para>
            <para>(e)The term &#8216;release from operations&#8217; refers to the process of withdrawal from use of a system/equipment from the operational environment, and &#8216;return into operations&#8217; refers to the process whereby the system/equipment is checked and restored to operational use, in accordance with both risk assessment and mitigation.</para>
            <para>MAINTENANCE TASKS BY ATSEP</para>
            <para>(f)An operational system that has been released from operational service, but remains connected to the operational environment must be maintained by ATSEP.</para>
            <para>(g)An operational system that has been removed and fully isolated from the operational environment by ATSEP, and cannot be returned without ATSEP intervention, may be maintained by a non-ATSEP, but will be subject to the ANSP&#8217;s checks before return to the operational environment.</para>
            <para>(h)A non-ATSEP is not authorised to remove an operational system from the operational environment.</para>
            <para>(i)A non-ATSEP is not authorised to return a system into the operational environment.</para>
            <para>(j)An ATSEP is responsible for determining the operational system status/serviceability before returning it to the operational environment.</para>

It may be used for production, sales, end use or other purpose. Data product specification provides a means by which the content of a data set is precisely specified. A data product specification supports the party generating a data set by providing information as to what exactly should be included within the data set. The content of the data product specification is closely related to the metadata. The users of the data may determine, by comparing their data product specification with the metadata, how the data may be used in their application and what mitigations, if any, are needed as result of, for example, the quality/completeness of the data.</para>

              <para>COORDINATION ARRANGEMENTS BETWEEN COMPETENT AUTHORITIES FOR SELECTION AND REVIEW OF MULTI-ACTOR CHANGES</para>
              <para>(a)When the notification of a change to a service provider&#8217;s functional system indicates, as per AMC1 ATM/ANS.OR.A.045(a), that the change will affect the services provided by other service providers either directly or by affecting the context in which these services are delivered, these other service providers and the notifying service provider are participating in a multi-actor change. Some or all of these other service providers may also notify their competent authorities because they either have to make a reactive change or they are participating in a cooperative change to their functional systems.</para>
              <para>(b)If there are service providers participating in the multi-actor change who are proposing to make changes to their functional systems and are under the oversight of more than one competent authority, then the decision to review and the review itself of safety assessments and safety support assessments has to be a coordinated activity involving all the competent authorities that oversee the service providers participating in the multi-actor change.</para>
              <para>(c)Normally, competent authorities act independently when making decisions on how to select and review safety assessments, but in the case of multi-actor changes that cross State boundaries, the only way to ensure the effective selection and review of the notified changes is through coordination with other competent authorities. Coordination arrangements, which are difficult to define in advance, are to be established when the need arises. The objective of these agreements should be to ensure that the overall change is safe, i.e. the overall safety case is based on a complete and correct set of assumptions and mitigations and the associated risk assessments are valid.</para>
              <para>(d)The arrangements should ensure that:</para>
              <para>(1)the competent authorities involved evaluate in a harmonised way the risk posed by the change, and as a consequence there is an agreement on what safety (support) assessments will be reviewed by each competent authority; and</para>
              <para>(2)individual reviews of safety (support) assessments assure the necessary conditions are met, i.e. common assumptions and common mitigations are used correctly in each safety (support) assessment and the identified risks are valid.</para>
              <para>(e)However, the assurance that the set of common assumptions and common mitigations are complete and correct cannot be provided in each individual safety case. The argument for that assurance has to be made in an overall safety case and reviewed collectively by the competent authorities involved in the overall change. The form of this collective review should be included in the coordination agreement.</para>

              <para>(a)The safety directive is a document issued by the competent authority, mandating actions to be performed by one or more service providers, when evidence shows that aviation safety may otherwise be compromised. Thus, the competent authority is responsible for the determination of the actions required and their rationale.</para>

              <para>(e)Standard working time could be expressed either in working hours or in working days per inspector for the oversight of services provision and other ATM network functions. All planning calculations should then be based on the same unit (hours or working days).</para>
              <para>(f)For each service provider, the number of working hours/days per planning period for each qualified inspector for the oversight of services provision and other ATM network functions that may be allocated for certification, oversight and enforcement activities should be determined taking into account:</para>
              <para>(1)purely administrative tasks not directly related to oversight and certification;</para>

              <para>The review by the competent authority is focused on the change management procedures and not on the project management part of these procedures that are not required by the regulations, even though they may be useful for the smooth execution of the project dealing with the change. Consequently, not all parts of a procedure may be approved by the competent authority. The approved parts should be identified in the record (see AMC1 ATM/ANS.AR.B.015(a)(8)) and communicated to the service provider.</para>

              <para>SELECTION CRITERIA FOR REVIEWING A NOTIFIED CHANGE TO THE FUNCTIONAL SYSTEM</para>
              <para>The need for review should be based on a combination of the likelihood that the safety (support) argument may be complex or unfamiliar to the service provider undertaking the change and the severity of the consequences associated with the change. This is a risk function and is referred to as the &#8216;risk posed by the change&#8217;.</para>
              <para>The following two aspects of the change:</para>
              <para>the novelty of the change; and</para>
              <para>the capabilities of the service provider (e.g. the effectiveness of the service provider&#8217;s (safety) management system),</para>
              <para>as well as the service provider performing the change contribute to the service provider&#8217;s unfamiliarity of the necessary argument. The assessment of the severity of the consequence is made at a very early stage in the development of the change and, therefore, will be based on coarse data. It should, therefore, be conservative.</para>
              <para>The risk posed by a change could be a scalar measure associated with the change and be some combination of the two inputs: the probability of a complex or unfamiliar argument and the severity of the consequences of the proposed change. The result is that the risk posed by a particular change is the sum of the inputs.</para>
              <para>One possibility may be based on the use of a risk matrix in which risk parameters are represented according to a coarse-grained measurement scheme, and the selection criteria establish the boundary beyond which changes will be selected for review, as shown below:</para>
              <para>The selection criterion, a function of risk with the value &#8216;significant&#8217;, is then a straight line, if the scales are logarithmic.</para>

              <para>OTHER SELECTION CRITERIA</para>
              <para>(a)Some changes may not necessarily need to be reviewed providing that, even though they relate to safety, they can be considered as routine by the provider as they have been consistently assessed, implemented and proved safe in the past and, therefore, the competent authority has sufficient confidence that the provider will address them in a similar manner.</para>
              <para>(b)The selection criterion for review may deviate from a simple threshold on the scalar risk metric (distance from the origin), to deal with concerns due to the coarse grain and high uncertainty of the inputs. For instance, a separate threshold on the &#8216;severity&#8217; axis may be used to specify, for instance:</para>
              <para>(1)that changes with very high potential severity should always be reviewed, irrespective of the probability of the safety argument being incomplete and/or incorrect ( REF _Ref419300201 \h \* MERGEFORMAT Figure below). This criterion may well respond to common perceptions and could be justified by the fact that judgements of low probabilities based on limited information are often unreliable, and errors in the judgment of risk are proportional to the error on probability and the size of the loss; and</para>
              <para>(2)that changes with minor potential severity need not be reviewed, irrespective of the probability of the safety argument being incomplete and/or incorrect ( REF _Ref419300211 \h \* MERGEFORMAT Figure below) (though the process may retain the option for the competent authority to review the change, since the estimate itself of potential severity may be suspected of being erroneous).</para>
              <para>(c)It is also possible that deviations be required on the basis of some of the component factors that affect either probability or severity, e.g. exempting changes based on small size of change and high competence of the air traffic services provider.</para>
              <para>(d)In order to validate the process or provide data for the evolution of the process, it may be advisable to randomly select changes to review and then assess whether the safety argument is complete and/or correct or not and whether or not the case would have been selected for review using the current criteria for the selection process.</para>

            <para>(a)The competent authority shall have a system to analyse findings for their safety significance and decide on enforcement measures on the basis of the safety risk posed by the service provider's non-compliance.</para>
            <para>(b)In circumstances where no or very low additional safety risk would be present with immediate appropriate mitigation measures, the competent authority may accept the provision of services to ensure continuity of service whilst corrective actions are being taken.</para>
            <para>(c)A level 1 finding shall be issued by the competent authority when any serious non-compliance is detected with the applicable requirements of Regulation (EC) No&#160;216/2008 and its implementing rules as well as Regulations (EC) No 549/2004, (EC) No 550/2004, (EC) No 551/2004, and (EC) No 552/2004 and their implementing rules, with the service provider's procedures and manuals, with the terms of conditions of certificate or certificate, with the designation act, if applicable, or with the content of a declaration which poses a significant risk to flight safety or otherwise calls into question the service provider's capability to continue operations.</para>
            <para>Level 1 findings shall include but not be limited to:</para>
            <para>(1)promulgating operational procedures and/or providing a service in a way which introduces a significant risk to flight safety;</para>
            <para>(2)obtaining or maintaining the validity of the service provider's certificate by falsification of submitted documentary evidence;</para>
            <para>(3)evidence of malpractice or fraudulent use of the service provider's certificate;</para>
            <para>(4)the lack of an accountable manager.</para>
            <para>(d)A level 2 finding shall be issued by the competent authority when any other non-compliance is detected with the applicable requirements of Regulation (EC) No&#160;216/2008 and its implementing rules as well as Regulations (EC) No 549/2004, (EC) No 550/2004, (EC) No&#160;551/2004, and (EC) No 552/2004 and their implementing rules, with the service provider's procedures and manuals or with the terms of conditions or certificate, or with the content of a declaration.</para>
            <para>(e)When a finding is detected, during oversight or by any other means, the competent authority shall, without prejudice to any additional action required by Regulation (EC) No 216/2008 and this Regulation, as well as Regulations (EC) No 549/2004, (EC) No 550/2004, (EC) No&#160;551/2004 and (EC) No 552/2004 and their implementing rules, communicate the finding to the service provider in writing and require corrective action to address the non-compliance(s) identified.</para>
            <para>(1)In the case of level 1 findings, the competent authority shall take immediate and appropriate action, and may, if appropriate, limit, suspend or revoke in whole or in part the certificate while ensuring the continuity of services provided that safety is not compromised, and in the case of the Network Manager, it shall inform the Commission. The measure taken shall depend upon the extent of the finding and shall remain until successful corrective action has been taken by the service provider.</para>
            <para>(2)In the case of level 2 findings, the competent authority shall:</para>
            <para>(i)grant the service provider a corrective action implementation period included in an action plan appropriate to the nature of the finding;</para>
            <para>(ii)assess the corrective action and implementation plan proposed by the service provider and, if the assessment concludes that they are sufficient to address the non-compliance(s), accept them.</para>
            <para>(3)In the case of level 2 findings, where the service provider fails to submit a corrective action plan that is acceptable to the competent authority in light of the finding, or where the service provider fails to perform the corrective action within the time period accepted or extended by the competent authority, the finding may be raised to a level 1 finding, and action taken as laid down in point (1).</para>
            <para>(f)For those cases not requiring level 1 and 2 findings, the competent authority may issue observations.</para>

              <para>(a)To recognise which of the annexes applies to which service provider, it is necessary to understand how services are defined. These definitions have determined the structure and the content of Annexes III to XIII.</para>
              <para>(b)Article 3(q) of Regulation (EC) No 216/2008 defines ATM/ANS as &#8216;the air traffic management functions as defined in Article 2(10) of Regulation (EC) No 549/2004, air navigation services defined in Article 2(4) of that Regulation, and services consisting in the origination and processing of data and formatting and delivering data to general air traffic for the purpose of safety-critical air navigation&#8217;.</para>
              <para>(c)It should, therefore, be noted that ATM/ANS include more services than &#8216;Air Traffic Management&#8217; and &#8216;Air Navigation Services&#8217; together.</para>
              <para>(d)In this Regulation, &#8216;services&#8217; refers to those specified in Annex VIII(2) to Regulation (EU) 2018/1139.</para>
              <para>(e)As already defined, &#8216;ATM network functions&#8217; refers to functions performed by the Network Manager in accordance with Regulation (EU) No&#160;677/2011.</para>
              <para>(f)Figure 1 below provides a pictorial representation of the services and how they interrelate through the various definitions.</para>
              <para>(g)Figure 1 indicates both a further breakdown of ATS into air traffic control services (ATC), alerting services, air traffic advisory services, and flight information services and groupings of:</para>
              <para>(1)air traffic management (ATM): comprising ATS, ASM, and ATFM;</para>

              <para>(3)flight procedure design services (FPD) and data services (DAT) and ATM network functions.</para>
              <para>(h)It is important to note that ATS is included in ATM and ANS.</para>

              <para>(6)the planning for conducting flight tests can be of a very ad hoc nature giving little timing for carrying out strategy or pre-tactical air traffic flow management.

              <para>then the air traffic services provider providing services to this type of flight testing may need a specific privilege within the certificate issued by the competent authority because of the specificities of the air traffic services to be provided to this type of operations and because of the need to ensure safe operations in the airspace in which flight tests are being conducted.</para>
              <para>(b)Given the characteristics in (a), flight tests can be made in cohabitation with other airspace users in controlled or non-controlled airspace, and sometimes in temporarily reserved areas when necessary.</para>

              <para>ED Decision 2020/008/R</para>
              <para>NOTIFICATION</para>
              <para>(a)A change should be notified as soon as the data defined in AMC1&#160;ATM/ANS.OR.A.045(a) is available. The decision to review a change by the competent authority will be based, in most circumstances, on the notification data. Exceptions to this are cases where the competent authority is not familiar with the type of change or the complexity of the change requires a more thorough consideration.</para>
              <para>(b)Early and accurate notification facilitates the interactions between the provider and the competent authority and, thus, maximises the likelihood of introducing a change into service in due time and according to the service provider&#8217;s initial schedule when the competent authority has decided to review an assurance case. Therefore, it is advisable that the change description identified in AMC1&#160;ATM/ANS.OR.A.045(a) is completed as soon as possible and contains the following data:</para>
              <para>(1)Purpose of the change;</para>
              <para>(2)Reasons for the change;</para>
              <para>(3)Place of implementation;</para>
              <para>(4)New/modified functions/services brought about by the change;</para>
              <para>(5)High-level identification of the constituents of the functional system being changed, and what is modified in their functionality;</para>
              <para>(6)Consequence of the change, i.e. the harmful effects of the hazards associated with the change &#8212; see (f) below and also the definition of &#8216;risk&#8217; in Annex I (85).</para>
              <para>(c)The information provided in (b) may expedite the decision whether to review or not the proposed change, because it will allow the competent authority to gain complete knowledge of the change and, consequently, reduces the need for additional information. However, lack of some of this data should not delay the service provider&#8217;s submission of the notification if to do so is likely to impede the introduction of the change. It should be noted that early interaction with its competent authority may help to complete the missing data.</para>
              <para>(d)The service provider should take into account that an early, clear and accurate change notification will assist the competent authority in making the decision to review or not the change and may prevent any inconvenience such as:</para>
              <para>(1)the competent authority having to ask for more information about the change in order to make its decision as required in ATM/ANS.OR.A.045(a)(2);</para>
              <para>(2)the competent authority deciding to review a change unnecessarily because the notification is not clear enough; or</para>
              <para>(3)the delay in the competent authority deciding whether to review a change, caused by the lack of information, having an impact on the proposed date of entry into service.</para>
              <para>(e)It is recognised that the understanding of the change will improve as the change process progresses and the interaction between the competent authority and the service provider strengthens. The service provider should notify the competent authority when the information provided in the previous notification is no longer valid or when the information previously missing becomes available. When additional information &#8212; other than the data specified in AMC1&#160;ATM/ANS.OR.A.045(a) &#8212; is supplied at the competent authority&#8217;s request, then no update of the notification is required.</para>
              <para>(f)For air traffic services (ATS) providers, the consequences of the change specified in (b)(6), should be expressed in terms of the harmful effects of the change, i.e. the effects of the hazards associated with safety risks. These could be the result of a preliminary safety assessment, if available, or an early hazard analysis that concentrates on the service level effects. For service providers other than air traffic services providers, the consequences should be expressed in terms of what aspects of the performance of the service are impacted by the change.</para>
              <para>(g)The point of contact, as required in point (j) in AMC1&#160;ATM/ANS.OR.A.045(a), provides a focal point for the competent authority to contact when seeking complementary information about the change when required. The aim is to improve communications between the provider and the competent authority about the change.</para>
              <para>(h)All notified changes should be unambiguously identified. The service provider and its competent authority should agree on a means of referencing so as to associate a unique identifier to a given notified change.</para>
              <para>(i)For routine changes, the notification to the competent authority may be done in a simpler manner, e.g. using forms less detailed than those specified in AMC1&#160;ATM/ANS.OR.A.045(a) or notifying these changes collectively after being implemented at regular periods of times agreed between the provider and the competent authority. A service provider and its competent authority should coordinate so as to reach a common agreement on these types of changes that may not be reviewed by the competent authority. The list of such changes should be documented and formalised. The formalised agreement becomes part of the change management procedures identified in ATM/ANS.OR.B.010. Consequently, the list will be reviewed by the competent authority as part of the audits it performs that are described in ATM/ANS.AR.C.010(a). The relevant audit activity is detailed in AMC1&#160;ATM/ANS.AR.C.010(a)(a)(2).</para>

              <para>Depending on the complexity of the change to the functional system and the criticality of the software, the depth of the evaluation may vary. The service provider should coordinate as soon as possible with the competent authority in order to define a software oversight strategy as part of the change review activities, if a decision for change review is taken.</para>

              <para>(a)No matter whether the competent authority has decided to review the notified change or not, the service provider should not start the implementation of any part of the change that has the potential to affect the safety of any of the services it provides, e.g. the functions performed or the performance of the services, until it has produced a valid argument in accordance with ATS.OR.205(a)(2) or/and ATM/ANS.OR.C.005(a)(2), as appropriate.</para>
              <para>(b)Implementation of the change, which means the creation and installation of the items to be used in the changed operational system may or may not affect the performance of the current services offered by the service provider. For example, much of the implementation of equipment and procedures can be performed &#8216;off line&#8217;, i.e. in development facilities that do not interact with the operational services and installation may be started, provided the items are not connected to the operational system and their presence in the operational environment does not affect the current services. However, these items must not be introduced into the operational system, i.e. they must not affect the behaviour of any operational service, until a valid assurance case exists and, if the change is subject to competent authority review, before the competent authority has approved the change.</para>
              <para>(c)The installation of an artefact may have an impact on services other than the service being changed. This can happen where the installation involves disrupting these other services, e.g. aerodrome operations may be disrupted because runways or taxiways are being used by constructor&#8217;s vehicles or are being interfered with. In this case, the scope of the change includes these other services (please refer to ATM/ANS.OR.C.005(a)(1)(iii) &amp; (iv) or ATS.OR.205(a)(1)(iii) &amp; (iv), as appropriate) and the assessment of the change includes the effects installation may have on them, including where the installation does not go according to plan.</para>

              <para>A change as defined in ATM/ANS.OR.A.045(e) may involve more than one service provider changing their functional systems. In this case, the change will consist of a set of changes to different ATM/ANS functional systems or their context. However, no matter how many individual changes to service providers&#8217; functional systems are part of the change, they should be coordinated. An overarching safety argument, coherent with the arguments of the individual changes, that claims the complete change is safe should be provided.</para>

              <para>(a)Any change proposed by a service provider as defined in ATM/ANS.OR.A.045(a) affects other service providers and/or aviation undertakings when:</para>
              <para>(1)the proposed change may alter the service delivered to other service providers and aviation undertakings as users of that service; or</para>
              <para>(2)the proposed change may alter the operational context in which the services of other service providers and aviation undertakings are delivered or in which the aviation undertakings are operating.</para>
              <para>(b)The changes referred to in ATM/ANS.OR.A.045(e) could be considered &#8216;multi-actor changes&#8217; and are those changes that require coordination between the service provider(s) proposing the change and any service providers and aviation undertakings affected by the change(s) due to the presence of dependencies between the service providers that planned the change and other affected service providers and/or other aviation undertakings. This coordination is essential to ensure a correct safety (support) assessment when there are dependencies.</para>
              <para>(c)A single-actor change is one that is limited to those cases where a change to a service provider&#8217;s functional system alters neither the service nor the operational context of other service providers and aviation undertakings.</para>

              <para>(c)This coordination means that the affected service providers:</para>
              <para>(1)have jointly identified the scope of their responsibilities with regard to the change, and in particular their safety responsibilities, e.g. what part of the change will be covered in whose safety (support) assessment case;</para>

              <para>COORDINATION WITH AFFECTED AVIATION UNDERTAKINGS</para>
              <para>(a)The aviation undertakings are the entities, persons or organisations as defined in point 34 of Annex I to Regulation (EU) 2017/373 and thus, ATM/ANS.OR.A.045(e) does not apply to them. However, any service provider affected by a change should seek the participation of aviation undertakings when assumptions and risk mitigations used in the safety (support) assessment are shared with those aviation undertakings.</para>
              <para>(b)When the number of aviation undertakings affected by the change is large, the service providers may not need to involve every individual stakeholder. If a body can represent the views of a group of affected aviation undertakings, it may suffice to involve that representative body to obtain the supporting evidence to move forward with the assessment of the change.</para>

              <para>(a)If an aviation undertaking decides not to cooperate, the service provider, who has identified dependencies with the aviation undertaking, in accordance with ATM/ANS.OR.A.045(e)(1), needs to consider the impact of having the assumptions and risk mitigations not agreed with that aviation undertaking. It should propose a way forward by doing one or more of the following:</para>
              <para>(1)making the assumptions themselves and providing evidence that supports them;</para>
              <para>(2)adding additional mitigating measures so that the change remains acceptably safe;</para>

              <para>(b)If more than one person is assigned such responsibility, the ATM/ANS provider should identify a single person to act as the main focal point for ensuring a single reporting channel is established to the accountable manager. This should in particular apply to ATM/ANS providers that hold one or more additional organisation certificates within the scope of Regulation (EU) 2018/1139 and its delegated and implementing acts where the occurrence-reporting system is fully integrated with that required under the additional certificate(s) held.</para>

              <para>(a)The reporting to the organisations defined in point ATM/ANS.OR.A.065 does not affect the need to report to other organisations with which the ATM/ANS provider interfaces, and which might be involved in or be affected by the reported event (e.g. other service providers, including contracted parties in accordance with point ATM/ANS.OR.B.015, involved in an occurrence, aerodrome operators, etc.).</para>
              <para>(b)Any ATM/ANS provider that reports to the organisation responsible for the design of the air traffic management (ATM)/air navigation services (ANS) systems and ATM/ANS constituents should actively support any investigations that may be initiated by that organisation. Support should be provided by a timely response to information requests and by making available affected system components or constituents, for the purpose of the investigation, subject to an agreement with the respective system component or constituent owners.</para>
              <para>(c)In addition to reporting to the organisation responsible for the design of the ATM/ANS systems and ATM/ANS constituents, if different from the ATM/ANS provider, the ATM/ANS provider may be required to report to the aerodrome operator, to other ATM/ANS providers or air operators.</para>
              <para>(d)To ensure effective reporting between organisations, it is important that:</para>

              <para>(a)When determining which failures of systems and constituents are to be reported, a degree of practicality is required as it is not intended that every failure is reported. Only those that have or may have an impact on the safety of the provision of services are reported.</para>
              <para>(b)When nothing is defined in European Union or national legislation, the determination of the failures of systems and constituents that need to be reported is done by the service provider and needs to be approved by the competent authority. This determination can be done as a result of an assessment of the installations or changes to the systems and constituents.</para>
              <para>(c)The organisation responsible for the design of the systems and constituents may no longer exist or may no longer support the design. In this case, the service provider will have made arrangements to ensure that the safety of the systems and constituents can be assured by appropriate and practical means. In many cases, this means that the service provider has taken over the design responsibilities.</para>
              <para>(d)Within the application of Regulation (EC) No 552/2004, the organisation responsible for the design of the constituent will be the entity that signs the Declaration of Conformity or Suitability for use. For systems and constituents which existed before the applicability date of Regulation (EC) No 552/2004, the service provider should identify the responsible organisation, otherwise the service provider should make appropriate arrangements.</para>

              <para>(a)Stating that resolution needs to be commensurate with the actual accuracy means that digital data needs to have sufficient resolution to maintain accuracy. Typically, if an accuracy of .1 unit is needed, then a resolution of 0.01 or .001 units would enable a data chain to preserve the accuracy without issue. A finer resolution could be misleading as one could assume that it supports a finer accuracy. This factor range of 10 to 100 between accuracy and resolution is applicable regardless of the units of measurements used.</para>

              <para>(a)Validation</para>
              <para>(1)Validation is the activity where a data element is checked as having a value that is fully applicable to the identity ascribed to the data element, or where a set of data elements are checked as being acceptable for their intended use.</para>
              <para>(2)The application of validation techniques considers the entire aeronautical data chain. This includes the validation performed by prior data chain participants and any requirements levied on the data supplier.</para>
              <para>(3)Examples of validation techniques</para>
              <para>(i)Validation by application</para>
              <para>One method of validation is to apply data under test conditions. In certain cases, this may not be practical. Validation by application is considered to be the most effective form of validation. For example, flight inspection of final approach segment data prior to publication can be used to ensure that the published data is acceptable.</para>
              <para>(ii)Logical consistency</para>
              <para>Logical consistency validates by comparing two different data sets or elements and identifying inconsistencies between values based on operative rules (e.g. business rules).</para>
              <para>(iii)Semantic consistency</para>
              <para>Semantic consistency validates by comparing data to an expected value or range of values for the data characteristics.</para>
              <para>(iv)Validation by sampling</para>
              <para>Validation by sampling evaluates a representative sample of data and applies statistical analysis to determine the confidence in the data quality.</para>
              <para>(b)Verification</para>
              <para>(1)Verification is a process for checking the integrity of a data element whereby the data element is compared to another source, either from a different process or from a different point in the same process. While verification cannot ensure that the data is correct, it can be effective to ensure that the data has not been corrupted by the data process.</para>
              <para>(2)The application of verification techniques considers only the portion of the aeronautical data chain controlled by the organisation. Yet, verification techniques may be applied at multiple phases of the data processing chain.</para>
              <para>(3)Examples of verification techniques</para>
              <para>(i)Feedback</para>
              <para>Feedback testing is the comparison between the output and input state of a data set.</para>

Provision of means to mitigate the intentional corruption of digitally transmitted data may already exist within the organisational construct and operating procedures of participating entities.</para>
              <para>(c)The objective of data security is to ensure that data is received from a known source and that there is no intentional corruption during processing and exchange of data.</para>
              <para>(d)Records should be maintained to show what data security provisions have been implemented.</para>
              <para>(e)Provisions supporting this objective may include:</para>
              <para>(1)implementation of technical data security measures to provide authentication and prevent intentional corruption during exchange of data (e.g. secure hashes, secure transmissions, digital signatures); and</para>

              <para>MEAN SEA LEVEL</para>
              <para>(a)The geoid globally most closely approximates mean sea level (MSL). It is defined as the equipotential surface in the gravity field of the Earth which coincides with the undisturbed MSL extended continuously through the continents.</para>
              <para>(b)Gravity-related heights (elevations) are also referred to as &#8216;orthometric heights&#8217;, while distances of points above the ellipsoid are referred to as &#8216;ellipsoidal heights&#8217;.</para>
              <para>(c)Global and local geoids differ in their origin: global geoids consider only the long- and middle-wave part of the Earth&#8217;s gravity field, whilst local geoids also consider the short-wave part of the gravity field. Global geoids are used when consistent orthometric heights, over long distances (continent or earth surveying), are required. Currently, the world&#8217;s best global geoid model is EGM 200846. It was determined using satellite tracking, gravity anomalies and satellite altimetry. Its accuracy is in the range of &#177; 0.05 m (oceans) and &#177; 0.5 m (on land). This accuracy is higher in flat regions than in topographically mountainous terrain, such as the Alps.</para>
              <para>(d)For local engineering applications and cadastre-surveying, global geoids are not as accurate as needed. For such applications, local geoid models are calculated. These can only be developed using local field measurements. They offer centimetre accuracy over several hundred kilometres, with a high resolution. Local geoids are not suitable for height comparison over large distances since they are based on different origins and reference heights (different equipotential levels).</para>

              <para>RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE TYPE OF SERVICE AND SAFETY MANAGEMENT &#8212; QUALITY MANAGEMENT</para>
              <para>(a)All service providers are required to establish and maintain a management system. However, only an air traffic services provider can have managerial control over functions directly affecting the safety of the flight (e.g. the ATCO to separate aircraft from each other). Hence, the management system requirements in Annex III, which apply to all service providers, are more broadly associated with the quality of the service rather than the safety of the service. Annex&#160;IV (Part-ATS) has specific safety management requirements for the provision of air traffic services. Therefore, only the air traffic services provider (that providing air traffic control, alerting service, air traffic advisory service or flight information service) is required to have a safety management system and undertake safety assessment of changes to the functional system.</para>
              <para>(b)Service providers other than the air traffic services provider can still affect the safety of the flight through functions or services they provide, but this will always be influenced by the way in which the air traffic services provider or airspace user are using those functions or services. Therefore, service providers other than air traffic services providers have a management system which manages the performance of service (rather than the safe use of their services for flight navigation and the control which is beyond the managerial control of the service provider). This performance of the service refers to such properties of the service provided such as accuracy, reliability, integrity, availability, timeliness, etc.</para>
              <para>(c)It is quite likely that air traffic services providers have contractual arrangements in place with other service providers, whose services they use, specifying the required performance and requiring the service provider to inform, in a timely manner, the air traffic services provider of any impact on the performance of services supplied.</para>
              <para>(d)When the service provider other than an air traffic services provider provides services or functions directly to a flight (e.g. MET) without involving air traffic services, then the safe use of those services is the responsibility of the users of those services.</para>
              <para>(e)When the air traffic services provider also provides other services, it may choose to combine the necessary performance and safety management activities into an integrated management system covering all services.</para>

              <para>SAFETY CULTURE</para>
              <para>The policy should actively encourage effective safety reporting and, by defining the line between acceptable performance (often unintended errors) and unacceptable performance (such as negligence, recklessness, violations or sabotage), provide fair protection to reporters. A safety or just culture may not, however, preclude the &#8216;criminalisation of error&#8217;, which is legally, ethically and morally within the sovereign rights of any Member State, provided that European Union law and established international agreements are observed. A judicial investigation, and consequences of some form, may be expected following an accident or serious incident especially if a system failure resulted in lives lost or property damaged, even if no negligence or ill intent existed. A potential issue could, therefore, exist if voluntary hazard reports, which relate to latent deficiencies of a system or its performance, are treated in the same way as those concerning accident and serious incident investigations. The intent of protecting hazard reports should not challenge the legitimacy of a judicial investigation or demand undue immunity.</para>

              <para>SAFETY PERFORMANCE MONITORING AND MEASUREMENT &#8212; ATS PROVIDER</para>
              <para>(a)The means to monitor performance is often through one or more leading or lagging indicators.</para>
              <para>(b)Indicators and performance measures provide feedback on what is happening so that the air traffic services provider can take appropriate actions to respond to changing circumstances. The indicators provide information on:</para>
              <para>(1)what is happening around the air traffic services provider;</para>
              <para>(2)how well the air traffic services provider is doing;</para>
              <para>(3)what has happened so far; and</para>
              <para>(4)warning of impending problems or dangers that the air traffic services provider may need to take action to avoid.</para>
              <para>(c)Although &#8216;lagging&#8217; performance indicators that measure the final outcomes resulting from the air traffic services provider&#8217;s activities are often considered as the most interesting, lagging indicators themselves may not provide enough information to guide the air traffic services provider&#8217;s actions and ensure success.</para>
              <para>(d)By measuring the inputs to a process, leading performance indicators can complement the use of lagging indicators and compensate for some of their shortcomings. Leading indicators can be used to monitor the effectiveness of control systems and give advance warning of any developing weaknesses before problems occur. One purpose of leading performance indicators is, therefore, to show the condition of systems before accidents, incidents, harm, damage or failure occurs. In this way, they can help to control risks and prevent mishaps.</para>
              <para>(e)There is good evidence that when leading performance indicators are used correctly, they are effective in improving performance. However, there is also good evidence that they can be misused.</para>
              <para>(f)For leading performance indicators to play an effective role in the improvement process, there should be an association between the inputs that the leading performance indicators measure and the desired lagging outputs. There needs to be a reasonable belief that the actions taken to improve leading performance indicators will be followed by an improvement in the associated lagging output indicators.</para>
              <para>(g)The process for effective use of leading performance indicators can be summarised as:</para>
              <para>(1)Identify where there are potential weaknesses or opportunities for improvement;</para>
              <para>(2)Identify what can be done to counter weaknesses or deliver improvement;</para>
              <para>(3)Set performance standards for the actions identified;</para>
              <para>(4)Monitor performance against the standards;</para>
              <para>(5)Take corrective actions to improve performance; and</para>
              <para>(6)Repeat the process by using the following continuous improvement model:</para>
              <para>(h)For any performance indicator to be effective, it is important that it is:</para>
              <para>(1)objective and easy to measure and collect;</para>
              <para>(2)relevant to the air traffic services provider whose performance is being measured;</para>
              <para>(3)capable of providing immediate and reliable indications of the level of performance;</para>
              <para>(4)cost-efficient in terms of the equipment, personnel and additional technology required to gather the information;</para>
              <para>(5)understood and owned by the air traffic services provider whose performance is being measured;</para>
              <para>(6)related to activities considered to be important for future performance;</para>
              <para>(7)amenable to intervention/influence by the air traffic services provider whose performance is being measured;</para>
              <para>(8)related to something where there is scope to improve; and</para>
              <para>(9)a clear indication of a means to improve performance.</para>

              <para>A performance indicator (PI) is a type of performance measurement. An organisation may use PIs to evaluate its success, or to evaluate the success of a particular activity in which it is engaged. Sometimes success is defined in terms of making progress towards strategic goals, but often success is simply the repeated, periodic achievement of some level of operational goal (e.g. zero defects). Accordingly, choosing the right PIs relies upon a good understanding of what is important to the organisation. Since there is a need to understand well what is important, various techniques to assess the present state of the business, and its key activities, are associated with the selection of PIs. These assessments often lead to the identification of potential improvements, so performance indicators are routinely associated with 'performance improvement' initiatives. When PIs have performance targets associated with them, they are known as key performance indicators (KPIs).</para>

              <para>IDENTIFICATION OF CHANGES TO FUNCTIONAL SYSTEMS</para>
              <para>This process is used by the service provider to correctly identify proposed changes. The changes dealt with in this GM are the proposed changes to the functional system. These can be triggered internally by changing circumstances that are related to the service provider of concern or externally by changing circumstances that are related to others or to the context in which the service operates, i.e. in situations where the service provider does not have managerial control over them. The triggers are called &#8216;change drivers&#8217;.</para>
              <para>(a)Identification of internal circumstances</para>
              <para>(1)The procedure to identify changes needs to be embedded in all parts of the organisation that can modify the functional system, i.e. the operational system used to support the services provided. Examples of proposed changes to the functional system as a response to changing circumstances under the control of the organisation, therefore, include:</para>
              <para>(i)changes to the way the components of the functional system are used;</para>
              <para>(ii)changes to equipment, either hardware or software;</para>
              <para>(iii)changes to roles and responsibilities of operational personnel;</para>
              <para>(iv)changes to operating procedures;</para>
              <para>(v)changes to system configuration, excluding changes during maintenance, repair and alternative operations that are already part of the accepted operational envelope;</para>
              <para>(vi)changes that are necessary as a result of changing circumstances to the operational context under the managerial control of the provider that can impact the service, e.g. provision of service under new conditions;</para>
              <para>(vii)changes that are necessary as a result of changing circumstances to the local physical (operational) environment of the functional system; and</para>
              <para>(viii)changes to the working hours and/or shift patterns of key personnel which could impact on the safe delivery of services.</para>
              <para>(2)These changes are often identified by the service provider using business processes, which will be used to identify changes planned for the medium and long term. Such processes can include:</para>
              <para>(i)annual business plans;</para>
              <para>(ii)strategic safety boards;</para>
              <para>(iii)equipment replacement projects;</para>
              <para>(iv)airspace reorganisation plans;</para>
              <para>(v)introduction of new operational concepts, e.g. Free Flight;</para>
              <para>(vi)accident and incident investigation reports; and</para>
              <para>(vii)safety monitoring and safety surveys.</para>
              <para>(b)Identification of external circumstances</para>
              <para>The service provider should have processes in place to react appropriately to notifications received from those service providers that supply services to them. In addition, changes to the context that can impact on the service provided and are not under the managerial control of the service provider should be identified and treated as potential triggers. Furthermore, the service provider should negotiate contracts with unregulated service providers in accordance with ATM/ANS.OR.B.015&#8216;Contracted activities&#8217; that place a responsibility on such organisations to inform them of planned changes to their services.</para>

              <para>(2)The compliance monitoring function should be structured according to the size of the service provider and the complexity of the activities to be monitored, including those which have been subcontracted.</para>
              <para>(b)A service provider should monitor compliance with the procedures they have designed to ensure that services are provided with the required safety levels and quality, as applicable. In doing so, they should as a minimum, and where appropriate, monitor:</para>

              <para>(3)In the case the person responsible for compliance monitoring acts also as safety manager, the accountable manager, with regard to his or her direct accountability for safety, should ensure that sufficient resources are allocated to both functions, taking into account the size of the service provider and the nature and complexity of its activities.</para>

              <para>Within the scope of this Regulation, only the air traffic services provider can identify hazards, assess the associated risks and mitigate or propose mitigating measures where necessary. This requirement implies that all service providers (air traffic services and non-air traffic services) establish formal interfaces (e.g. service level agreements, letters of understanding, memorandum of cooperation) between the relevant services providers themselves or between the service providers and other aviation undertakings (e.g. aerodrome operators) so as to ensure that hazards associated with the use of the services they provide are identified and the risks assessed and whenever needed mitigated. It does not imply that this has to be done by the service providers themselves (e.g. MET or AIS providers cannot do this by themselves) as only the air traffic services provider can, but they need to establish the interfaces with those service providers (ATS providers) or other aviation undertaking (e.g. aerodrome operators) who are able to do so. The formal interfaces could address the mitigation means put on the different providers (e.g. via requirements in a service level agreement).</para>

              <para>(a)The safety support assessment should be conducted by the service provider itself. It may also be carried out by another organisation, on its behalf, provided that the responsibility for the safety support assessment remains with the service provider.</para>
              <para>(b)A safety support assessment needs to be performed when a change affects a part of the functional system managed by a service provider other than an air traffic services provider and it is being used in the provision of its services. The safety support assessment or the way it is conducted does not depend on whether the change is a result of a business decision or a decision to improve the service performance.</para>

              <para>SCOPE OF THE CHANGE</para>
              <para>(a)The description of the elements being changed includes the nature, functionality, location, performance, maintenance tasks, training and responsibilities of these elements, where applicable. The description of interfaces and interactions, between machines and between humans and machines, should include communication means, e.g. language, phraseology, protocol, format, order and timing and transmission means, where applicable. In addition, it includes the description of the context in which they operate.</para>
              <para>(b)There are two main aspects to consider in evaluating the scope of a change:</para>
              <para>(1)The interactions within the changed functional system.</para>
              <para>(2)The interactions within the changing functional system, i.e. those that occur during transitions from the current functional system to the changed system. During such transitions, components are replaced/installed in the functional system. These installation activities are interactions within the changing functional system and are to be included within the scope of the change.</para>
              <para>As each transition can be treated as a change to the functional system, the identification of both the above has a common approach described below.</para>
              <para>(c)The scope of the change is defined as the set of the changed components and affected components. In order to identify the impacted components and the changed components, it is necessary to:</para>
              <para>(1)know which components will be changed;</para>
              <para>(2)know which component&#8217;s (components&#8217;) behaviour might be affected by the changed components, although it is (they are) not changed itself (themselves); and</para>
              <para>(3)detect indirectly affected components by identifying:</para>
              <para>(i)new interactions introduced by the changed or directly affected components;</para>
              <para>(ii)interactions with changed or directly affected components via the context.</para>
              <para>Furthermore, directly and indirectly impacted components will be identified as a result of applying the above iteratively to any directly and indirectly impacted components that have been identified previously.</para>
              <para>The scope of the change is the set of changed, directly impacted and indirectly impacted components identified when the iteration identifies no new components.</para>
              <para>(d)The context in which the changed service is intended to be provided (see ATM/ANS.OR.C.005(a)(1)(iii)) includes the interface through which the service will be delivered to other service providers.</para>

              <para>TRAINING</para>
              <para>If the change modifies the way people interact with the rest of the functional system, then they will require training before the change becomes operational. Care should be taken when training operational staff before the change is operational, as the training may change the behaviour of the operational staff when they interact with the existing functional system before any other part of the change is made, and so the training may have to be treated as a transitional stage of the change. For example, as a result of training, ATCOs may come to expect information or alerts to be presented differently. People may also need refreshment training periodically in order to ensure that their performance does not degrade over time. The training needed before operation forms part of the design of the change, while the refreshment training is part of the maintenance of the functional system after the change is in operation.</para>

              <para>INTERACTIONS</para>
              <para>The identification of changed interactions is necessary in order to identify the scope of the change because any changed behaviour in the system comes about via a changed interaction. Changed interaction happens via an interaction at an interface of the functional system and the context in which it operates. Consequently, identification of both interfaces and interactions is needed to ensure that all interactions have identified interfaces and all interfaces have identified interactions. From this, all interactions and interfaces that will be changed can be identified.</para>

                <para>COMPLETENESS OF THE ARGUMENT</para>
                <para>(a)Sufficiency of specifications</para>
                <para>The way the service specification is arrived at is not of particular interest in a safety support case and so it is not dealt with here. A specification that is sufficient implies that the service meets the provider&#8217;s intent, i.e. it is valid. Two necessary conditions for a sufficient specification are provided here:</para>
                <para>(1)Assessment of failure conditions</para>
                <para>(i)Failures or failure conditions are malfunctions of behaviour. This means either the loss or corruption of some intended behaviour, e.g. behaviour that is considered to be:</para>
                <para>(A)more than (quantity, information);</para>
                <para>(B)less than (quantity, information);</para>

                <para>(F)part of;</para>
                <para>(G)reverse of;</para>

                <para>that which was intended. If the behaviour of the service is altered in any way during malfunctions, the altered behaviour needs to be included in the specification. Further details could be found GM1 ATM/ANS.OR.C.005(b)(1) and GM1&#160;ATM/ANS.OR.C.005(b)(2).</para>
                <para>(ii)Some failures may not result in a degraded service.</para>
                <para>(iii)Some failures may not be relevant in the context of use.</para>
                <para>(iv)Strictly speaking, the failure and failure conditions described here are malfunctions of the services delivered by a component and may be caused by failures of components, errors in design, failures of services used by the component, or failures of the activities associated with installing the component, i.e. failure to install the component in the intended manner.</para>
                <para>(v)When a redundancy within a component is no longer available, the behaviour of the component is considered to have changed, e.g. the reliability of the component will have changed and an indication of the loss of redundancy will have been provided.</para>
                <para>(2)Evaluation of the behaviour</para>
                <para>It is necessary to argue that the behaviour of the implementation, i.e. the system as built, matches the specification and there is no additional (unspecified) behaviour. This implies verification of service behaviour, which is required by ATM/ANS.OR.C.005(b)(2) and stated here in a more specific way.</para>
                <para>It is also necessary to argue that the behaviour of the change during transition into service matches the specification and there is no additional (unspecified) behaviour. If transition into service causes disruption to the service being changed or other services provided by the service provider, then it may be necessary to include, within the specification, a specification of the intended installation activities. This implies an assessment of failure conditions associated with the installation activities and the specification of any necessary mitigations, should the failures materialise and the installation not be performed as intended.</para>
                <para>(b)Safety support requirements</para>
                <para>(1)The safety support requirements are characteristics/items of the functional system to ensure that the system operates as specified. Based on the verification/demonstration of these characteristics/items, it could be concluded that the specifications are met.</para>
                <para>(2)The highest-layer of safety support requirements represents the desired behaviour of the change at its interface with the operational context. These, ultimately become the specification, once the implementation is verified.</para>
                <para>(3)In almost all cases, verification that a system behaves as specified cannot be accomplished to an acceptable level of confidence at the level of its interface with its operational environment. To this end, the system verification should be decomposed into verifiable parts, taking into account the following principles:</para>
                <para>(i)Verification relies on requirements placed on these parts via a hierarchical decomposition of the top-level requirements, in accordance with the constraints imposed by the chosen architecture.</para>
                <para>(ii)At the lowest level, this decomposition places requirements on elements, where verification that the implementation satisfies its requirements can be achieved by testing.</para>
                <para>(iii)At higher levels in the architecture, during integration, verified elements of different types are combined into subsystems/components, in order to verify more complete parts of the system.</para>
                <para>(iv)While they cannot be fully tested, other verification techniques may be used to provide sufficient levels of confidence that these subsystems/components do what they are supposed to do.</para>
                <para>(v)Consequently, since decomposing the system into verifiable parts relies on establishing requirements for those parts, then safety support requirements are necessary.</para>
                <para>(4)The way safety support requirements are achieved, is not of particular interest in a safety assessment, because a safety support argument demonstrates the trustworthiness of the specification.</para>
                <para>(5)The architecture may not have requirements. During development, the need to argue satisfaction of system level requirements, which cannot be performed at the system level for any practical system, drives the architecture because verifiability depends on the decomposition of the system into verifiable parts.</para>
                <para>(6)Demonstration that safety support requirements at system level are met allows them to be transformed into the safety support specification.</para>
                <para>(c)Satisfaction of safety support requirements</para>
                <para>(1)The concept laid down in AMC2&#160;ATM/ANS.OR.C.005(a)(2) is that, provided the system and each subsystem/component/element meet its requirements, the system will behave as specified. This will be true provided (2), (3) and (4) below are met.</para>
                <para>(2)The activity needed to meet objective (c) of AMC2&#160;ATM/ANS.OR.C.005(a)(2)consists of obtaining sufficient confidence that the set of requirements is complete and correct, i.e. that:</para>
                <para>(i)the architectural decomposition leads to a complete and correct set of requirements being allocated to each subsystem/component/element;</para>
                <para>(ii)each requirement is a correct, complete and unambiguous statement of the desired behaviour, and does not contradict another requirement or any other subset of requirements; and</para>
                <para>(iii)the requirements allocated to a subsystem/component/element necessitate the complete required behaviour of the subsystem/component/element in the target environment.</para>
                <para>(3)This should take into account specific aspects such as:</para>
                <para>(i)the possible presence of functions within the subsystem/component/element that produce unnecessary behaviour. For instance, in the case where a previously developed part is used, activities should be undertaken to identify all the possible behaviours of the part. If any of these behaviours is not needed for the foreseen use, then additional requirements may be needed to make sure that these functions are not solicited or inadvertently activated in operation or that the effects of any resulting behaviour are mitigated;</para>
                <para>(ii)subsystem/component/element requirements that are not directly related to the desired behaviour of the functional system. This kind of requirement can, for instance, ask that the subsystem/component/element be developed in a given syntax or be designed in a certain way. These requirements often relate to technical aspects of the subsystem/component/element. Activities should be undertaken to ensure that each of these requirements is a correct, complete and unambiguous statement of the desired effect, and does not contradict another requirement or any other subset of requirements.</para>
                <para>(4)The system behaviour should be considered complete in the sense that the specification is only true for the defined context. This restriction to the context of the use of the service makes safety support assessment and assurance of changes to the functional system a practical proposition.</para>
                <para>(d)Traceability of requirements</para>
                <para>The traceability requirement can be met by tracing to the highest-level element in the architectural hierarchy that has been shown to satisfy its requirements, by verifying it in isolation. It is likely and completely acceptable that this point will be reached at a different architectural level for each element.</para>
                <para>(e)Satisfaction of safety support requirements</para>
                <para>(1)The component view taken must be able to support verification, i.e. the component must be verifiable &#8212; see guidance in (b).</para>
                <para>(2)Care should be taken in selecting subsystems that are to be treated as components for verification to ensure that they are small and simple enough to be verifiable.</para>
                <para>(3)The context argument needs to demonstrate that the context in which a component is verified does not compromise the claim that the specification is true over a specified context, i.e. the component verification context is correctly related to the context claimed for the operation of the functional system.</para>
                <para>(f)Configuration identification</para>
                <para>(1)This is only about configuration of the evidence and should not be interpreted as configuration management of the functional system. However, since the safety support assessment is based on a set of elements and the way they are interlinked, the safety support assessment should only be valid if the configuration remains as described in the safety support argument.</para>
                <para>(2)Evidence for the use of a component should rely on testing activities considering the actual usage of domains and contexts. When the same component is used in different parts of the system or in different systems, it may not be possible to rely on testing in a single context since it is unlikely that the contexts for each use will be the same or can be covered by a single set of test conditions. This applies equally to the reuse of evidence gathered from testing subsystems.</para>

              <para>ASSURANCE &#8212; SOFTWARE ASSURANCE PROCESSES</para>
              <para>(a) The software assurance processes should provide evidence and arguments that they, as a minimum, demonstrate the following:</para>
              <para>(1) The software requirements correctly state what is required by the software, in order to meet the service and safety support requirements, as identified by the safety support assessment (AMC2&#160;ATM/ANS.OR.C.005(a)(2)). For that purpose, the software requirements should:</para>
              <para>(i) be correct, complete and compliant with the upper level requirements; and</para>
              <para>(ii) specify the functional behaviour, in nominal and downgraded modes, timing performances, capacity, accuracy, resource usage on the target hardware, robustness to abnormal operating conditions and overload tolerance, as appropriate, of the software.</para>
              <para>(2) The traceability is addressed in respect of all software requirements as follows:</para>
              <para>(i) Each software requirement should be traced to the same level of design at which its satisfaction is demonstrated.</para>
              <para>(ii)Each software requirement allocated to a component should either be traced to an upper level requirement or its need should be justified and assessed that it does not affect the satisfaction of the safety support requirements allocated to the component.</para>
              <para>(3) The software implementation does not contain functions that adversely affect the satisfaction of the service specification.</para>
              <para>(4) The functional behaviour, timing performances, capacity, accuracy, resource usage on the target hardware, robustness to abnormal operating conditions and overload tolerance, of the implemented software comply with the software requirements.</para>
              <para>(5) The software verification is correct and complete, and is performed by analysis and/or testing and/or equivalent means, as agreed with the competent authority.</para>
              <para>(b) The evidence and arguments produced by the software assurance processes should be derived from:</para>
              <para>(1) a known executable version of the software;</para>
              <para>(2)a known range of configuration data; and</para>
              <para>(3) a known set of software items and descriptions, including specifications, that have been used in the production of that version, or can be justified as applicable to that version.</para>
              <para>(c) The software assurance processes should determine the rigour to which the evidence and arguments are produced.</para>
              <para>(d) The software assurance processes should include the necessary activities to ensure that the software life cycle data can be shown to be under configuration control throughout the software life cycle, including the possible evolutions due to changes or problems&#8217; corrections. They should include, as a minimum:</para>
              <para>(1)configuration identification, traceability and status accounting activities, including archiving procedures;</para>
              <para>(2) problem reporting, tracking and corrective actions management; and</para>
              <para>(3) retrieval and release procedures.</para>
              <para>(e) The software assurance processes should also cover the particularities of specific types of software such as commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS), non-developmental software and previously developed software where generic assurance processes cannot be applied. The software assurance processes should include other means to give sufficient confidence that the software meets the service and safety support requirements. If sufficient assurance cannot be provided, complementary mitigation means aiming at decreasing the impact of specific failure modes of this type of software, should be applied. This may include but is not limited to:</para>
              <para>(1) software and/or system architectural considerations;</para>
              <para>(2) existing service level experience; and</para>

                <para>ASSURANCE &#8212; SOFTWARE ASSURANCE LEVELS</para>
                <para>(a) The assurance required by AMC6 ATM/ANS.OR.C.005(a)(2) can be provided with different levels of confidence depending on the rigour to which the evidence and arguments are produced. Whereas, for air traffic services (ATS) providers, the use of the SWAL concept can be helpful to provide an explicit link between the criticality of the software and the rigour of the assurance, for service providers other than ATS providers, the use of the SWAL concept may not be relevant considering that non-ATS providers may not be aware of the safety aspects of the ATS provider using their services. However, considering that the safety support assessment will be based on the evidence and arguments generated by the software assurance processes and that the safety support assessment will support a safety assessment, it is foreseen that, in many changes, the software assurance evidence and arguments will have to demonstrate a certain level of confidence and therefore will have to show compliance with the SWAL allocated by the ATS provider.</para>
                <para>(b) The use of multiple SWALs would also allow the possibility of managing several criticalities of the different software components within the system (with partitioning or other architectural strategies) by the same set of software assurance processes. When the software assurance processes employ several SWALs, they should define for each SWAL the rigour of the assurances to achieve compliance with the objectives set out in AMC6&#160;ATM/ANS.OR.C.005(a)(2). As a minimum:</para>
                <para>(1) the rigour should increase as the criticality of the service supported by the software solution increases; and</para>
                <para>(2) the variation in rigour of the evidence and arguments per SWAL should include a classification of the activities and objectives according to the following criteria:</para>
                <para>(i)required to be achieved with independence, i.e. the verification process activities are performed by a person (or persons) other than the developer of the item being verified;</para>
                <para>(ii)required to be achieved; and</para>

                <para>The process to allocate a SWAL to a software consistently with its foreseen criticality, as identified by the safety support assessment and requirements, should consider the following elements:</para>
                <para>(a) The SWAL allocation should relate the rigour of the software assurances to the foreseen criticality of the software.</para>
                <para>(b) The allocated SWAL should be commensurate with the worst credible effect that software malfunctions (i.e. the inability of a programme to perform a required function correctly) or failures(i.e. the inability of a programme to perform a required function) may cause, as assessed by the ATS provider that is planning to make use of the non-ATS services.</para>
                <para>(c) The software components that cannot be shown to be independent of one another should be allocated to the SWAL of the most critical of the dependent components. In this context, the term &#8216;software components&#8217; is understood to be a building block that can be fitted or connected together with other reusable blocks of software to combine and create a custom software application, and &#8216;independent software components&#8217; are those software components which are not rendered inoperative by the same failure condition.</para>
                <para>(d) The allocated SWALs should be consistent with the levels defined in the software assurance processes.</para>

                <para>ASSURANCE &#8212; EXAMPLES OF EXISTING INDUSTRIAL STANDARDS</para>
                <para>(a) The service provider is responsible for the definition of the software assurance processes. In this definition of processes, the service provider may consider the guidance material contained in existing industrial standards for the software assurance considerations of software. It should be considered that not all standards address all aspects required and the service provider may need to define additional software assurance processes. The guidance material typically includes:</para>
                <para>(1) objectives of the software life cycle processes;</para>
                <para>(2) activities for satisfaction of those objectives;</para>
                <para>(3) descriptions of the evidence, in the form of software life cycle data, that indicates that the objectives have been satisfied;</para>
                <para>(4) variations according to the SWAL, to accommodate the different levels of rigour of the software assurances; and</para>
                <para>(5) particular aspects (e.g. previously developed software) that may be applicable to certain applications.</para>
                <para>(b) The following table presents some of the existing industrial standards (at the latest available issue) used by the stakeholders:</para>
                <para>EUROCAE ED-109A/RTCA DO-278A and EUROCAE ED-12C/RTCA DO-178C make reference to some external documents (supplements), which are integral part of the standard for the use of some particular technologies and development techniques. The supplements are the following:</para>
                <para>(1)Formal Methods Supplement to ED-12C and ED-109A (EUROCAE ED-216/RTCA DO-333)</para>
                <para>(2)Object-Oriented Technology and related Techniques Supplement to ED-12C and ED-109A (EUROCAE ED-217/RTCA DO-332)</para>
                <para>(3)Model-Based Development and Verification Supplement to ED-12C and ED-109A (EUROCAE ED-218/RTCA DO-331)</para>
                <para>When tools are used during the software development lifecycle, EUROCAE ED-215/RTCA DO330 &#8216;Software Tool Qualification Considerations&#8217; may be considered in addition to EUROCAE ED12C RTCA/DO-178C and EUROCAE ED-109A/RTCA DO-278A.</para>
                <para>(c) The definition of the software assurance processes may be based on one of these industrial standards, without combining provisions from different standards as far as the consistency and validation of each of the industrial standards have only been performed at individual level by each specific standardisation group.</para>

              <para>(a)The use of assurance level concepts, e.g. design assurance levels (DALs), software assurance levels (SWALs), hardware assurance levels (HWALs), can be helpful in generating an appropriate and sufficient body of evidence to help establish the required confidence in the argument.</para>
              <para>(b)The term &#8216;software assurance level (SWAL)&#8217; is understood to be the level of rigour of the software assurances throughout the software lifecycle. In this context, the software life cycle is understood to be:</para>
              <para>(1)an ordered collection of processes determined by an organisation to be sufficient and adequate to produce a software item;</para>
              <para>(2)the period of the time that begins with the decision to produce or modify a software item and ends when the item is retired from service.</para>

              <para>The complete behaviour is limited to the scope of the change. Safety support requirements only apply to the parts of a system affected by the change. In other words, if parts of a system can be isolated from each other and only some parts are affected by the change, then these are the only parts that are of concern and so will have safety support requirements attached to them.</para>

              <para>(c)for procedures, the circumstances for their enactment, the resources needed to perform the procedure (i.e. people and equipment), the sequence of actions to be performed and the timing and accuracy of the actions; and</para>

              <para>ATM/ANS.OR.C.005(b)(1)(ii) requires that the service meets its specification. Consequently, the specification must be complete and valid, i.e. it includes the behaviour addressed in ATM/ANS.OR.C.005(b)(1)(iii) and any additional behaviour in the specified context.</para>
              <para>(b)Compliance with other requirements</para>
              <para>(1)ATM/ANS.OR.C.005(b)(1)(iii) requires the service providers to identify all parts of this Regulation that impose behaviour on the changed service and also includes any conditions attached to the certificate.

The identified behaviour shall be included in the specification of the changed service.</para>
              <para>Note that the Regulation or conditions attached to the certificate may render compliance with technical standards and ICAO SARPs mandatory.</para>
              <para>(2)Compliance with other non-mandatory standards may also be a necessary condition for other reasons.</para>
              <para>(3)ATM/ANS.OR.C.005(b)(1)(iii) does not state that the service only meets the requirements of the other parts of this Regulation. It may do other things as well, as described in (5) below.</para>

              <para>(a)Monitoring is intended to maintain confidence in the safety support argument during operation of the changed functional system. Monitoring is, therefore, only applicable following the entry into service of the change.</para>
              <para>(b)Monitoring is likely to be of internal parameters of the functional system that provide a good indication of the performance of the service. These parameters may not be directly observable at the service level, i.e. at the interface of the service with the operational environment. For example, where a function is provided by multiple redundant resources, the availability of the function will be so high that monitoring it may not be useful. However, monitoring the availability of individual resources, which fail much more often, may be a useful indicator of the performance of the overall function.</para>

            <para>(6)obstacle data;</para>
            <para>(7)geographical position data.</para>
            <para>(b)The tables of the aeronautical data catalogue are composed of the following columns:</para>
            <para>(1)subject for which data can be collected;</para>
            <para>(2)property: an identifiable characteristic of a subject which may be further defined into sub-properties;</para>
            <para>(3)same as 2;</para>
            <para>(4)types: the data is classified into different types;</para>
            <para>(5)description: a description of the data item;</para>
            <para>(6)notes: containing additional information or conditions for the provision of the data;</para>
            <para>(7)accuracy: requirements for aeronautical data are based on a 95 % confidence level;</para>
            <para>(8)integrity classification;</para>
            <para>(9)origination type: data is identified as surveyed, calculated or declared;</para>

            <para>(11)chart resolution.</para>
            <para>Note for items 2 and 3 under point (b): the classification of a catalogue element as subject, property or sub-property doesnot impose a certain data model.</para>
            <para>Note for item 7 under point (b): for those fixes and points that serve a dual purpose, e.g. holding point and missedapproach point, the higher accuracy applies. Accuracy requirements for obstacle and terrain data are based on a 90 %confidence level.</para>
            <para>Note for item 10 under point (b): the publication resolutions for geographical position data (latitude and longitude) areapplicable to coordinates formatted in degrees, minutes, seconds. When a different format is used (such as degrees withdecimals for digital data sets) or when the location is significantly further to the north/south, the publication resolutionneeds to be commensurate with the accuracy requirements.</para>

                <para>Air traffic control contingencies related to communications, i.e. circumstances preventing an air traffic controller from communicating with aircraft under control, may be caused by either a failure of ground radio equipment, a failure of airborne equipment, or by the control frequency being inadvertently blocked by an aircraft or a ground transmitter, or any unauthorised use. The duration of such events may be for prolonged periods and appropriate action to ensure that the safety of aircraft is not affected should therefore be taken immediately.</para>

                <para>(1)In the event of complete failure of the ground radio equipment used for air traffic control service, the air traffic controller should:</para>
                <para>(i)attempt to establish radio communications on the emergency frequency 121.500 MHz;</para>
                <para>(ii)without delay inform all adjacent control positions or air traffic control units, as applicable, of the failure;</para>

                <para>(iv)request their assistance, in respect of aircraft which may establish communications with those positions or units, in establishing and maintaining separation between such aircraft; and</para>
                <para>(v)instruct adjacent control positions or air traffic control units to hold or re-route all controlled flights outside the area of responsibility of the position or air traffic control unit that has experienced the failure until such time that the provision of normal services can be resumed,</para>
                <para>unless able to continue to provide air traffic services by means of other available communication channels.</para>
                <para>(2)In order to reduce the impact of complete ground radio equipment failure on the safety of air traffic, the air traffic services provider should establish contingency procedures to be followed by control positions and air traffic control units in the event of such failures. Where agreed between affected air traffic services providers, such contingency procedures should provide for the delegation of control to an adjacent control position or air traffic control unit in order to permit a minimum level of services to be provided as soon as possible, following the ground radio failure and until normal operations can be resumed.</para>

                <para>(1)attempt to identify the aircraft concerned;</para>
                <para>(2)if the aircraft blocking the frequency is identified, attempts should be made to establish communication with that aircraft, e.g. on the emergency frequency 121.500 MHz, by SELCAL, through the aircraft operator&#8217;s company frequency if applicable, on any VHF frequency designated for air-to-air use by flight crews or any other communication means or, if the aircraft is on the ground, by direct contact; and</para>
                <para>(3)if communication is established with the aircraft concerned, the flight crew should be instructed to take immediate action to stop inadvertent transmissions on the affected control frequency.</para>

                <para>Instances of false and deceptive transmissions on air traffic control frequencies which may impair the safety of aircraft can occasionally occur. In the event of such occurrences, the air traffic control unit concerned should:</para>
                <para>(1)correct any false or deceptive instructions or clearances which have been transmitted;</para>
                <para>(2)advise all aircraft on the affected frequency(ies) that false and deceptive instructions or clearances are being transmitted;</para>

                <para>ATS.OR.140 is complementary to the existing requirements on reporting stemming from Regulation (EU) No 376/2014 and on the reporting arrangements that ATM/ANS providers have to establish in accordance with principles and requirements on the management system set in ATM/ANS.OR.B.005 in Annex III to Regulation (EU) 2017/373. However, the primary objective of ATS.OR.140 is the timely dissemination of information needed for the safe and efficient air traffic control service and flight information service provision (e.g. information on changes in the availability of radio navigation services). The arrangements should also support the timely issuance of NOTAMs concerning the relevant information to be disseminated, in accordance with the applicable requirements in ATM/ANS.OR.A.085 in Annex III to Regulation (EU) 2017/373.</para>

                <para>(1)Metrics that measure inputs to the safety system (either within an organisation, a sector or across the total aviation system) to manage and improve safety performance.</para>
                <para>(2)Leading indicators measure the specific features of the aviation safety system designed to support continuous improvement and to give an indication of likely future safety performance. They are designed to help identify whether the providers and regulators are taking actions and/or have processes in place that are effective in lowering the risk.</para>
                <para>(b)Lagging indicators</para>
                <para>Metrics that measure the outcome of the service delivery by measuring events that have already occurred and that impact safety performance. There are two subsets of lagging indicators:</para>
                <para>(1)Outcome indicators: These include only the occurrences that one aims to prevent, for example fatal or catastrophic accidents. Depending on the system, the severity of the occurrences that are included as outcome indicators can be adjusted to include all accidents and serious incidents.</para>
                <para>(2)Precursor indicators: These indicators do not manifest themselves in accidents or serious incidents. They indicate less severe system failures or &#8216;near misses&#8217;, and are used to assess how frequently the system comes close to severe failure. Because they are typically more numerous than outcome indicators, they can be used for trend monitoring.</para>
                <para>(c)Safety management system</para>
                <para>In the case of a complex air traffic services provider, the SMS should include all of these measures. Risk management efforts, however, should be targeted at leading indicators and precursor events. The reason for doing this is to reduce the number of accidents and serious incidents.</para>
                <para>(d)Differing levels of safety performance monitoring</para>
                <para>(1)Measurements of safety in terms of undesirable events, such as accidents and incidents, are examples of &#8216;lagging indicators&#8217;, which can capture safety performance a posteriori. Such indicators give valuable signals to&#160;all involved in air traffic services &#8212; providers, regulators, and recipients &#8212; of the levels of safety being experienced and of the ability of the organisations concerned to take appropriate mitigation action.</para>
                <para>However, other types of measurement &#8212; &#8216;leading indicators&#8217; &#8212; can give a wider perspective of the safety &#8216;health&#8217; of the functional system, and focus on systemic issues, such as safety maturity and SMS performance.</para>
                <para>(2)A holistic approach to performance monitoring is an essential input to decision-making with regard to safety. It is important to ensure that good safety performance is attributable to good performance of the SMS, not simply to lack of incidents or accidents. It is also essential that the metrics chosen match the requirements of the stakeholders and decision-makers involved in safety improvement.</para>
                <para>(3)As shown in the diagram, stakeholders in the wider aviation industry and the general public require relatively small numbers of safety indicators (safety performance indicators or key performance indicators) which can give an instant &#8216;feel&#8217; for the overall position regarding safety performance. Conversely, those involved in the management of services concerned need a more detailed set of metrics on which to base decisions regarding the management of the services and facilities being reviewed.</para>

                <para>CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT OF THE SMS &#8212; COMPLEX ATS PROVIDERS</para>
                <para>(a)Substandard performance of the SMS can manifest itself in two ways. Firstly, where the SMS processes themselves do not fit their purpose (e.g. not adequately enabling the air traffic services provider to identify, manage and mitigate hazards and their associated risks) resulting in the safety performance of the service being impacted in a negative way. Secondly, where the SMS processes fit their purpose, but are not applied correctly or adequately by the personnel whose safety accountabilities and responsibilities are discharged through the application of the SMS. Personnel who have safety accountabilities and responsibilities are considered an essential part of the effectiveness of the SMS and viewed as part of the SMS.</para>
                <para>(b)Therefore, by detecting substandard performance of the SMS, the air traffic services provider can take action to improve the SMS processes themselves or to improve the application of the SMS processes by those with safety accountabilities and responsibilities resulting in an improvement to the safety performance.</para>
                <para>(c)Continuous improvement of the effectiveness of the safety management processes can be achieved through:</para>
                <para>(1)proactive and reactive evaluations of facilities, equipment, documentation, processes and procedures through safety audits and surveys; and</para>
                <para>(2)reactive evaluations in order to verify the effectiveness of the system for control and mitigation of risks.</para>
                <para>(d)In the same way that continuous improvement is sought through safety performance monitoring and measurement (see GM1ATM/ANS.OR.B.005(a)(3) and GM1 ATS.OR.200(3)(i)) by the use of leading&#160;and&#160;lagging indicators, continuous improvement of the SMS provides the air traffic services provider with safety assurance for the service.</para>
                <para>(e)As with safety performance monitoring, the continuous improvement of the SMS lends itself to a process that can be summarised as:</para>
                <para>(1)Identify where there are potential weaknesses or opportunities for improvement;</para>
                <para>(2)Identify what goes right and disseminate as best practice;</para>
                <para>(3)Identify what can be done to tackle weaknesses or lead to improvement;</para>
                <para>(4)Set performance standards for the actions identified;</para>
                <para>(5)Monitor performance against the standards;</para>
                <para>(6)Take corrective actions to improve performance; and</para>
                <para>(7)Repeat the process by using the continuous improvement model below:</para>
                <para>(f)Taking into account that the SMS is being required to manage safety, it can be assumed that by continuously improving the effectiveness of the SMS, ATS&#160;providers should be able to better manage and mitigate, and ultimately control the safety risks associated with the provisions of their services.</para>

                <para>(a)The safety assessment should be conducted by the air traffic services provider itself. It may also be carried out by another organisation, on its behalf, provided that the responsibility for the safety assessment remains with the air traffic services provider.</para>
                <para>(b)A safety assessment needs to be performed when a change affects a part of the functional system managed by the provider of air traffic services and that is being used in the provision of its (air traffic) services. The safety assessment or the way it is conducted does not depend on whether the change is a result of a business decision or a decision to improve safety.</para>

                <para>SCOPE OF THE CHANGE</para>
                <para>(a)The description of the elements being changed includes the nature, functionality, location, performance, maintenance tasks, training and responsibilities of these elements, where applicable. The description of interfaces and interactions, between machines and between humans and machines, should include communication means, e.g. language, phraseology, protocol, format, order and timing and transmission means, where applicable. In addition, it includes the description of the context in which they operate.</para>
                <para>(b)There are two main aspects to consider in evaluating the scope of a change:</para>
                <para>(1)The interactions within the changed functional system;</para>
                <para>(2)The interactions within the changing functional system, i.e. those that occur during transitions from the current functional system to the changed functional system. During such transitions, components are replaced/installed in the functional system. These installation activities are interactions within the changing functional system and are to be included within the scope of the change.</para>
                <para>As each transition can be treated as a change to the functional system, the identification of both the above has a common approach described below.</para>
                <para>(c)The scope of the change is defined as the set of the changed components and affected components. In order to identify the affected components and the changed components, it is necessary to:</para>
                <para>(1)know which components will be changed;</para>
                <para>(2)know which component&#8217;s (components&#8217;) behaviour might be directly affected by the changed components, although it is (they are) not changed itself (themselves);</para>
                <para>(3)detect indirectly affected components by identifying:</para>
                <para>(i)new interactions introduced by the changed or directly affected components; and/or</para>
                <para>(ii)interactions with changed or directly affected components via the environment.</para>
                <para>(4)Furthermore, directly and indirectly affected components will be identified as a result of applying the above iteratively to any directly and indirectly affected components that have been identified previously.</para>
                <para>The scope of the change is the set of changed, directly impacted and indirectly impacted components identified when the iteration identifies no new components.</para>
                <para>(d)The context in which the changed service is intended to operate (see ATS.OR.205(a)(1)(iii)) includes the interface through which the service will be delivered to its users.</para>

                <para>If the change modifies the way people interact with the rest of the functional system, then a training might be required before the change becomes operational. Care should be taken when training operational staff before the change is operational, as the training may change the behaviour of the operational staff when they interact with the existing functional system before any other part of the change is made, and so may have to be treated as a transitional stage of the change.&#160;</para>
                <para>For example, as a result of training, air traffic controllers (ATCOs) may come to expect information or alerts to be presented differently. People may also need refreshment training periodically in order to ensure that their performance does not degrade over time. The training needed before operation forms part of the design of the change, while the refreshment training is part of the maintenance of the functional system after the change is in operation.</para>

                <para>The identification of changed interactions is necessary in order to identify the scope of the change because any changed behaviour in the system comes about via a changed interaction. Changed interaction happens via an interaction at an interface of the functional system and the context in which it operates. Consequently, identification of both interfaces and interactions is needed to be sure that all interactions have identified interfaces and all interfaces have identified interactions. From this, all interactions and interfaces that will be changed can be identified.</para>

                  <para>COMPLETENESS OF THE ARGUMENT</para>
                  <para>(a)Sufficiency of safety criteria</para>
                  <para>(1)A sufficient set of safety criteria is one where the safety goal of the change is validly represented by the set of individual safety criteria, each criterion of which must be valid in its own right and not contradict another criterion or any other subset of criteria. A valid criterion is a correct, complete and unambiguous statement of the desired property. An individual valid criterion does not necessarily represent a complete safety criterion. An example of an invalid criterion is that the maximum take-off weight must not exceed 225 Tonnes because weight is measured in Newtons and not in Tonnes. An example of an incomplete criterion is that the accuracy must be 5&#160;m because no reliability attribute is present. This implies it must always be within 5&#160;m, which is impossible in practice.</para>
                  <para>(2)Optimally, a sufficient set of criteria would consist of the minimum set of non-overlapping valid criteria and it is preferable to a set containing overlapping criteria.</para>
                  <para>(3)Criteria that are not relevant, i.e. ones that do not address the safety goal of the change at all, should be removed from the set as they contribute nothing, may contradict other valid criteria and may serve to confuse.</para>
                  <para>(4)There are two forms of overlap: complete overlap and partial overlap.</para>
                  <para>(i)In the first case, one or more criteria can be removed and the set would remain sufficient, i.e. there are unnecessary criteria.</para>
                  <para>(ii)In the second case, (partially overlapping criteria) if any criterion were to be removed, the set would not be sufficient. Consequently, all criteria are necessary; however, validating the set would be much more difficult. Showing that a set of criteria with significant overlap do not contradict each other is extremely difficult and consequently prone to error.</para>
                  <para>(5)It may, in fact, be simpler to develop an architecture that supports non-overlapping criteria than to attempt to validate a partially overlapping set of criteria.</para>
                  <para>(b)Safety requirements</para>
                  <para>(1)The safety requirements are design characteristics/items of the functional system to ensure that the system operates as specified. Based on the verification/demonstration of these characteristics/items, it could be concluded that the safety criteria are met.</para>
                  <para>(2)The highest layer of safety requirements represents the desired safety behaviour of the change at its interface with the operational context.</para>
                  <para>(3)In almost all cases, verification that a system behaves as specified cannot be accomplished, to an acceptable level of confidence, at the level of its interface with its operational environment. To this end, the system verification should be decomposed into verifiable parts, taking into account the following principles:</para>
                  <para>(i)Verification relies on requirements placed on these parts via a hierarchical decomposition of the top level requirements, in accordance with the constraints imposed by the chosen architecture.</para>
                  <para>(ii)At the lowest level, this decomposition places requirements on elements, where verification that the implementation satisfies its requirements can be achieved by testing.</para>
                  <para>(iii)At higher levels in the architecture, during integration, verified elements of different types are combined into subsystems/components, in order to verify more complete parts of the system.</para>
                  <para>(iv)While they cannot be fully tested, other verification techniques may be used to provide sufficient levels of confidence that these subsystems/components do what they are supposed to do.</para>
                  <para>(v)Consequently, since decomposing the system into verifiable parts relies on establishing requirements for those parts, then safety requirements are necessary.</para>
                  <para>(4)The architecture may not have requirements. During development, the need to argue satisfaction of safety criteria, which cannot be performed at the system level for any practical system, drives the architecture because verifiability depends on the decomposition of the system into verifiable parts.</para>
                  <para>(c)Satisfaction of safety criteria</para>
                  <para>(1)The concept laid down in AMC2 ATS.OR.205(a)(2) is that, provided each element meets its safety requirements, the system will meet its safety criteria. This will be true provided (2) and (3) below are met.</para>
                  <para>(2)The activity needed to meet this objective consists of obtaining sufficient confidence that the set of safety requirements is complete and correct, i.e. that:</para>
                  <para>(i)the architectural decomposition of the elements leads to a complete and correct set of safety requirements being allocated to each sub-element;</para>
                  <para>(ii)each safety requirement is a correct, complete and unambiguous statement of the desired behaviour and does not contradict another requirement or any other subset of requirements; and</para>
                  <para>(iii)the safety requirements allocated to an element necessitate the complete required safety behaviour of the element in the target environment.</para>
                  <para>(3)This should take into account specific aspects such as:</para>
                  <para>(i)the possible presence of functions within the element that produce unnecessary behaviour. For instance, in the case where a previously developed element is used, activities should be undertaken to identify all the possible behaviours of the element. If any of these behaviours is not needed for the foreseen use, then additional requirements may be needed to make sure that these functions will not be solicited or inadvertently activated in operation or that the effects of any resulting behaviour are mitigated;</para>
                  <para>(d)other requirements that are not directly related to the desired behaviour of the functional system. These requirements often relate to technical aspects of the system or its components. Activities should ensure that each of these requirements does not compromise the safety of the system, i.e. does not contradict the safety requirements or criteria.</para>
                  <para>(e)Traceability of requirements</para>
                  <para>The traceability requirement can be met by tracing to the highest-level element in the architectural hierarchy that has been shown to satisfy its requirements, by verifying it in isolation.</para>
                  <para>(f)Satisfaction of safety requirements</para>
                  <para>(1)The component view taken must be able to support verification, i.e. the component must be verifiable.</para>
                  <para>(2)Care should be taken in selecting subsystems that are to be treated as components for verification to ensure that they are small and simple enough to be verifiable.</para>
                  <para>(g)Adverse effects on safety</para>
                  <para>(1)Interactions of all changed components or components affected by the change, operating in their defined context, have to be identified and assessed for safety in order to be able to show that they do not adversely affect safety. This assessment must include the failure conditions for all components and the behaviour of the services delivered to the component including failures in those services.</para>
                  <para>(2)Interactions between changing components, as they are installed during transitions into operation, and the context in which they operate have to be identified and assessed for safety in order to be able to show that they do not adversely affect safety. This assessment must include the failure conditions for all installation activities.</para>
                  <para>In some cases, installing components during transition into operation may cause disruption to services other than the one being changed. These services fall within the scope of the change (see GM1 ATM/ANS.OR.A.045(c); (d)), and consequently the safety effects failures of these services, due to failures of the installation activities, have to be assessed as well and, if necessary, their impacts mitigated.</para>
                  <para>(3)Interactions in complex systems are dealt with in ATM/ANS.OR.A.045(e)(1).</para>
                  <para>(h)Configuration identification</para>
                  <para>(1)AMC2 ATS.OR.205(a)(2), point (f) is only about configuration of the evidence and should not be interpreted as configuration management of the changed functional system. However, since the safety case is based on a set of elements and the way they are joined together, the safety case will only be valid if the configuration remains as described in the safety case.</para>
                  <para>(2)Evidence for the use of a component should rely on testing activities considering the actual usage domains and contexts. When the same component is used in different parts of the system or in different systems, it may not be possible to rely on testing in a single context since it is unlikely that the contexts for each use will be the same or can be covered by a single set of test conditions. This applies equally to the reuse of evidence gathered from testing subsystems.</para>

                <para>(a) When a change to a functional system includes the introduction of new software or modifications to existing software, the ATS provider should ensure the existence of documented software assurance processes necessary to produce evidence and arguments that demonstrate that the software behaves as intended (software requirements), with a level of confidence consistent with the criticality of the required application.</para>
                <para>(b) The ATS provider should use the software experience gained to confirm that the software assurance processes are effective and, when used, the allocated software assurance levels (SWALs) and the rigour of the assurances are appropriate. For that purpose, the effects from a software malfunction (i.e. the inability of a programme to perform a required function correctly) or failure (i.e. the inability of a programme to perform a required function) reported according to the relevant requirements on reporting and assessment of service occurrences should be assessed in comparison with the effects identified for the system concerned as per the severity classification scheme.</para>

                <para>ASSURANCE &#8212; SOFTWARE ASSURANCE PROCESSES</para>
                <para>(a) The software assurance processes should provide evidence and arguments that they, as a minimum, demonstrate the following:</para>
                <para>(1) The software requirements correctly state what is required by the software, in order to meet the upper level requirements, including the allocated system safety requirements as identified by the safety assessment of changes to the functional system (AMC2&#160;ATS.OR.205(a)(2)). For that purpose, the software requirements should:</para>
                <para>(i) be correct, complete and compliant with the upper level requirements; and</para>
                <para>(ii) specify the functional behaviour, in nominal and downgraded modes, timing performances, capacity, accuracy, resource usage on the target hardware, robustness to abnormal operating conditions and overload tolerance, as appropriate, of the software.</para>
                <para>(2) The traceability is addressed in respect of all software requirements as follows:</para>
                <para>(i) Each software requirement should be traced to the same level of design at which its satisfaction is demonstrated.</para>
                <para>(ii) Each software requirement allocated to a component should either be traced to an upper level requirement or its need should be justified and assessed that it does not affect the satisfaction of the safety requirements allocated to the component.</para>
                <para>(3) The software implementation does not contain functions that adversely affect safety.</para>
                <para>(4) The functional behaviour, timing performances, capacity, accuracy, resource usage on the target hardware, robustness to abnormal operating conditions and overload tolerance, of the implemented software comply with the software requirements.</para>
                <para>(5) The software verification is correct and complete, and is performed by analysis and/or testing and/or equivalent means, as agreed with the competent authority.</para>
                <para>(b) The evidence and arguments produced by the software assurance processes should be derived from:</para>
                <para>(1) a known executable version of the software;</para>
                <para>(2) a known range of configuration data; and</para>
                <para>(3) a known set of software items and descriptions, including specifications, that have been used in the production of that version, or can be justified as applicable to that version.</para>
                <para>(c) The software assurance processes should determine the rigour to which the evidence and arguments are produced.</para>
                <para>(d) The software assurance processes should include the necessary activities to ensure that the software life cycle data can be shown to be under configuration control throughout the software life cycle, including the possible evolutions due to changes or problems&#8217; corrections. They should include, as a minimum:</para>
                <para>(1) configuration identification, traceability and status accounting activities, including archiving procedures;</para>
                <para>(2) problem reporting, tracking and corrective actions management; and</para>
                <para>(3) retrieval and release procedures.</para>
                <para>(e) The software assurance processes should also cover the particularities of specific types of software such as COTS, non-development software and previously developed software where generic assurance processes cannot be applied. The software assurance processes should include other means to give sufficient confidence that the software meets the safety objectives and requirements, as identified by the safety risk assessment and mitigation processes. If sufficient assurance cannot be provided, complementary mitigation means aiming at decreasing the impact of specific failure modes of this type of software, should be applied. This may include but is not limited to:</para>
                <para>(1)software and/or system architectural considerations;</para>
                <para>(2)existing service level experience; and</para>
                <para>(3)monitoring.</para>

                  <para>(a) The assurance required by AMC4 ATS.OR.205(a)(2) can be provided with a level of confidence consistent with the criticality of the software in order to generate an appropriate and sufficient body of evidence to help to establish the required confidence in the argument.</para>
                  <para>(b) The use of the SWAL concept can be helpful to provide an explicit link between the criticality of the software and the rigour of the assurance.</para>
                  <para>(c) The use of multiple SWALs would also allow the possibility of managing several criticalities of the different software components within the system (with partitioning or other architectural strategies) by the same set of software assurance processes. When the software assurance processes employ on several SWALs, they should define for each SWAL the rigour of the assurances to achieve compliance with the objectives set out in AMC4 ATS.OR.205(a)(2). As a minimum:</para>
                  <para>(1) the rigour should increase as the criticality of the service supported by the software solution increases; and</para>
                  <para>(2) the variation in rigour of the evidence and arguments per SWAL should include a classification of the activities and objectives according to the following criteria:</para>
                  <para>(i) required to be achieved with independence, i.e. the verification process activities are performed by a person (or persons) other than the developer of the item being verified;</para>

                  <para>ASSURANCE &#8212; SOFTWARE ASSURANCE LEVELS ALLOCATION</para>
                  <para>The process to allocate a SWAL to a software consistently with its foreseen criticality, as identified by the risk assessment and mitigation process, should consider the following elements:</para>
                  <para>(a) The allocated SWAL should relate the rigour of the software assurances to the foreseen criticality of the software by using the combination of the used severity classification scheme with the likelihood of occurrence of a certain adverse effect.</para>
                  <para>(b) The allocated SWAL should be commensurate with the worst credible effect that software malfunctions (i.e. the inability of a programme to perform a required function correctly) or failures (i.e. the inability of a programme to perform a required function) may cause. It should, in particular, take into account the risks associated with software malfunctions or failures and the architecture and/or procedural defences.</para>
                  <para>(c) The software components that cannot be shown to be independent of one another should be allocated to the SWAL of the most critical of the dependent components. In this context, the term &#8216;software components&#8217; is understood to be a building block that can be fitted or connected together with other reusable blocks of software to combine and create a custom software application, and &#8216;independent software components&#8217; are those software components which are not rendered inoperative by the same failure condition.</para>
                  <para>(d) The allocated SWALs should be consistent with the levels defined in the software assurance processes of the ATS provider and of the non-ATS provider(s), when the safety case is based on the evidence presented in the corresponding safety support case(s).</para>

                  <para>(a) The service provider is responsible for the definition of the software assurance processes. In this definition of processes, the service provider may consider the guidance material contained in existing industrial standards for the software assurance considerations of software. It should be considered that not all standards address all aspects required and the service provider may need to define additional software assurance processes. The guidance material typically includes:</para>
                  <para>(1) objectives of the software life cycle processes;</para>
                  <para>(2) activities for satisfaction of those objectives;</para>
                  <para>(3) descriptions of the evidence, in the form of software life cycle data, that indicates that the objectives have been satisfied;</para>
                  <para>(4) variations according to the SWAL, to accommodate the different levels of rigour of the software assurances; and</para>
                  <para>(5) particular aspects (e.g. previously developed software) that may be applicable to certain applications.</para>
                  <para>(b) The following table presents some of the existing industrial standards (at the latest available issue) used by the stakeholders:</para>
                  <para>EUROCAE ED-109A/RTCA DO-278A and EUROCAE ED-12C/RTCA DO-178C make reference to some external documents (supplements), which are integral part of the standard for the use of some particular technologies and development techniques. The supplements are the following:</para>
                  <para>(1) Formal Methods Supplement to ED-12C and ED-109A (EUROCAE ED-216/RTCA DO-333)</para>
                  <para>(2) Object-Oriented Technology and related Techniques Supplement to ED-12C and ED-109A (EUROCAE ED-217/RTCA DO-332)</para>
                  <para>(3) Model-Based Development and Verification Supplement to ED-12C and ED-109A (EUROCAE ED-218/RTCA DO-331)</para>
                  <para>When tools are used during the software development lifecycle, EUROCAE ED-215/RTCA DO-330 &#8216;Software Tool Qualification Considerations&#8217; may be considered in addition to EUROCAE ED-12C/RTCA DO-178C and EUROCAE ED-109A/RTCA DO-278A.</para>
                  <para>(c) The definition of the software assurance processes may be based on one of these industrial standards, without combining provisions from different standards as far as the consistency and validation of each of the industrial standards have only been performed at individual level by each specific standardisation group.</para>

                  <para>(a) Within the scope of this Regulation, only the ATS provider can identify hazards, assess the associated risks and mitigate or propose mitigating measures where necessary. This requirement is also applicable to software assurance evidence which may include information on the mitigation measures established to address software failures or unintended behaviours.</para>
                  <para>(b) ATS and non-ATS providers may rely on different sets of software assurance processes and, if applicable, different sets of SWALs.</para>
                  <para>(c) For a particular change to the functional system, the safety assessment performed by the ATS provider, and documented in the safety case, may rely on evidence associated with the services provided by a non-ATS provider, as documented in its corresponding safety support case. It should as a minimum demonstrate that the rigour of the assurances produced by the non-ATS provider within the safety support case provides the adequate level of confidence for the purpose of the ATS safety demonstration in the safety case.</para>
                  <para>(d) If SWALs are used, the ATS provider should evaluate the adequacy of the SWALs defined in the software assurance processes of the non-ATS providers and the consistency of the allocated SWALs for the parts of the functional system affected by the change at the non-ATS provider.</para>

                <para>(a)The air traffic services provider can use a standard safety assessment method or it can use its own safety assessment method to assist with structuring the process. However, the application of a method is not a guarantee of the quality of the results. It is therefore not sufficient for a safety case to claim that the assurance provided is adequate due to compliance with a standard or method.</para>
                <para>(b)There are databases available that describe different safety assessment methods, tools and techniques that can be used by the air traffic services provider. The provider must ensure that the safety assessment method is adequate for the change being assessed and that the assumptions inherent in the use of the method are recognised and accommodated appropriately.</para>

                <para>(a)Completeness of hazard identification</para>
                <para>In order to achieve completeness in the identification of hazards, it might be beneficial to aggregate hazards and to formulate them in a more abstract way, e.g. at the service level. This might in turn have drawbacks when analysing and evaluating the risk of the hazards. The appropriate level of detail in the set of hazards and their formulation, therefore, depends on the change and the way the safety assessment is executed.</para>
                <para>Only credible hazards need to be identified. A credible hazard is one that has a material effect on the risk assessment. A hazard will not be considered credible when it is either highly improbable that the hazard will occur or that the accident trajectories it initiates will materialise. In other words, a hazard need not be considered if it can be shown that it induces an insignificant risk.</para>

                <para>(v)equipment and infrastructure, including failures, outages, error tolerances, nuisance alerts, defect defence systems and delays; and</para>
                <para>(vi)human performance, including restrictions due to fatigue and medical conditions, and physical limitations, when considered relevant to the change assessment.</para>
                <para>(2)Hazards introduced in the context in which the ATM/ANS functional system operates may include the following factors and processes:</para>
                <para>(i)wrong, insufficient or delayed information and inadequate services delivered by third parties;</para>
                <para>(ii)personnel factors, including working conditions, company policies for and actual practice of recruitment, training and allocation of resources, when considered relevant to the change;</para>
                <para>(iii)organisational factors, including the incompatibility of production and safety goals, the allocation of resources, operating pressures and the safety culture;</para>
                <para>(iv)work environment factors such as ambient noise, temperature, lighting, annoyance, ergonomics and the quality of man&#8211;machine interfaces; and</para>
                <para>(v)external threats such as fire, electromagnetic interference and sources of distraction, when considered relevant to the change.</para>
                <para>(3)The hazards introduced in the context in which the ATM/ANS services are delivered may include the following factors and processes:</para>
                <para>(i)errors, failures, non-compliance and misunderstandings between the airborne and ground domains;</para>
                <para>(ii)traffic complexity, including traffic growth, fleet mix and different types of traffic, when considered relevant to the change;</para>

                <para>(iv)inadequate service provisioning by third parties; and</para>
                <para>(v)external physical factors, including terrain, weather phenomena, volcanoes and animal behaviour, when considered relevant to the change.</para>
                <para>(c)Methods to identify hazards</para>
                <para>(1)The air traffic services provider may use a combination of tools and techniques, including functional analysis, what if techniques, brainstorming sessions, expert judgement, literature search (including accident and incident reports), queries of accident and incident databases in order to identify hazards.</para>
                <para>(2)The air traffic services provider needs to make sure that the method is appropriate for the change and produces (either individually or in combination) a valid (necessary and sufficient) set of hazards. This may be aided by drawing up a list of the functions associated with part of the functional system being changed. The air traffic services provider needs to make sure their personnel that use these techniques are appropriately trained to apply these methods and techniques.</para>

                  <para>Point (c) of AMC1 ATS.OR.205(b)(2) allows safety assessment to be performed in terms of risk, proxies or a combination of risk and proxies. This GM provides two examples to illustrate the use of proxies in safety analysis.</para>

                  <para>(1)A wind farm is to be introduced on or near an aerodrome. It is assumed that before the introduction of the wind farm, the safety risk of the air traffic services being provided at the aerodrome was acceptable. To return to this level after the introduction of the farm, the change would also be acceptable.</para>

                  <para>(ii)the movement of the blades will cause radio interference (communications radio and surveillance radar) and so communications may be lost or aircraft may be hidden from view on the radar screen; and</para>
                  <para>(iii)the flicker in the peripheral vision of ATCOs, caused by the rotation of the blades, may capture attention and increase their perception error rate.</para>
                  <para>(3)The problem of analysing the safety impact can be split into these areas of concern since they do not interact or overlap and so satisfy the independence criterion (b) of AMC2 ATS.OR.210(a). However, whilst it can be argued that each is a circumstantial hazard and that in each case a justifiable qualitative relationship can be established linking the hazard with the resulting accident (so satisfying the causality criterion (a) of AMC2 ATS.OR.210(a)), the actual or quantitative logical relationship is, in each case, extremely difficult to determine. Conditions for seeking proxies have, therefore, been established:</para>
                  <para>Performing a risk evaluation using actual risk may not be worthwhile due to the considerable cost and effort involved; and</para>
                  <para>The first two criteria for proxies have been satisfied.</para>
                  <para>Consequently, it may be possible to find proxies that can be used more simply and effectively than performing an analysis based on risk.</para>
                  <para>(4)The solutions proposed below are for illustrative purposes only. There are many other solutions and, for each change, several should be investigated. In this example, the following proxies, which satisfy the measurability criterion (c) of AMC2 ATS.OR.210(a), are used to set safety criteria:</para>
                  <para>(i)Turbulence can be measured and predicted by models so the level of turbulence can be a proxy.</para>
                  <para>In this example, let&#8217;s assume the only significant effect of turbulence is to light aircraft using a particular taxiway. It is possible to predict the level of turbulence at different sites on the aerodrome and an alternative taxiway is found where the level of turbulence after the introduction of the wind farm will be less than that currently encountered on the present taxiway. This can be confirmed during operation after the change by monitoring.</para>
                  <para>(ii)Signal quality can be also be predicted by models and measured so it can be used as a proxy.</para>
                  <para>In this example, it is possible to move the communications transmitter and receiver aerials so that communications are not affected by interference. Sites can be found using modelling and the signal quality confirmed prior to moving the aerials by trial installations during periods when the aerodrome is not operating.</para>
                  <para>(iii)Human error rate in detecting events on the manoeuvring area can be measured in simulations and can be used as a proxy.</para>
                  <para>It is suggested that increasing the opaqueness of the glass in the control tower will reduce the effects of flicker on the ATCOs, but there is no direct relationship between the transmissivity and the effects of flicker. It is, therefore, decided to make a simulation of the control tower and measure the effects of flicker on human error rate using glass of different levels of transmissivity.</para>
                  <para>However, there is a conflict between increasing the opaqueness of the glass to reduce the effects of flicker and decreasing it to improve direct vision, which is needed so that manoeuvring aircraft can be seen clearly. In other words, the simulation predicts a minimum for the human error rate that relates to a decrease, as the effects of flicker decrease, followed by an increase, as the effects of a lack of direct vision increase. This minimum is greater than the human error rate achieved by the current system and so the risk of the wind farm, in respect of flicker, cannot be completely mitigated. This is shown by the red box with a question mark in it on the diagram.</para>
                  <para>(5)Finally, the argument for the performance of surveillance radars is commonly performed using risk. This can be repeated in this case since the idea is to filter the effects of the interference without increasing the risk. Moreover, if necessary, a system may be added (or a current one improved) to reduce the risk simply and economically and the effects of the additional system may be argued using risk.</para>
                  <para>(6)Since risks can be combined, the safety impacts of the changes to the surveillance radar by filtering the effects of the interference together with the addition of another system or the improvement of the current system can be established by summing the risks associated with these two kinds of change.</para>
                  <para>(7)In these circumstances, it is not possible to argue objectively that the risk of introducing the wind farm has been mitigated, as risks cannot be summed with proxies. This demonstrates the difficulties of using proxies. However, it may be possible to argue convincingly, albeit subjectively, that installing another system or improving the current system improves the current level of risk by a margin large enough to provide adequate compensation for the unmitigated effects of flicker.</para>
                  <para>(8)In summary, this example shows how proxies and risks can be combined in a single assurance case to argue that a change to a functional system can be introduced safely. It also demonstrates that the strategies available to demonstrate safety are not generic, but are dependent on identifying analysable qualities or quantities related to specific properties of the system or service that are impacted by the change.</para>
                  <para>(b)Use of proxies when changing to electronic flight strips</para>
                  <para>(1)An air traffic services provider considers the introduction of a digital strip system in one of its air traffic control towers to replace the paper flight progress strips currently in use. This change is expected to have an impact on several aspects of the air traffic control service that is provided such as the controller&#8217;s recollection of the progress of the flight, the mental modelling of the traffic situation and the communication and task allocation between controllers. A change of the medium, from paper to digital, might, therefore, have implications on the tower operations, and, hence, on the safety of the air traffic. The actual relation between the change of the strip medium and the risk for the traffic is, however, difficult to establish.</para>
                  <para>(2)The influence of the quantity on the risk is globally known, but cannot easily be quantified. One difficulty is that strip management is at the heart of the air traffic control operations: the set of potential sequences of events from a strip management error to an accident or incident is enormous. This set includes, for example, the loss of the call sign at the moment a ground controller needs to intervene in a taxiway conflict, and whether this results in an incident depends, for example, on the visibility. This set also includes the allocation of a wrong standard instrument departure (SID) to an aircraft, and whether this results in an accident depends, for example, on the runway configuration.</para>
                  <para>Figure 2: Notional Bow Tie Model of a strip management error</para>
                  <para>(3)The Bow Tie Model of a strip management error has, figuratively speaking, a vertically stretched right part. This expresses that a hazard &#8212; such as the loss of a single strip &#8212; may have many different outcomes which heavily depend on factors that have nothing to do with the cause of the hazard &#8212; factors such as the status of the aircraft corresponding to the absent strip, that aircraft&#8217;s position on the aerodrome, the traffic situation and the visibility.</para>
                  <para>(4)Another difficulty with the relationship between the change of the medium and the risk to the air traffic is that several human and cultural aspects are involved. The difficulty lies in the largely unknown causal relationship between these human and cultural aspects and the occurrences of accidents and incidents. As an example of this, it is noted that strip manipulation &#8212; like moving a strip into another bay, or making a mark to indicate that a landing clearance is given &#8212; assists a controller in distinguishing the potential from the actual developments. The way of working with paper strips generates impressions in a wider variety than digital strips by their physical nature: handling paper strips has tactile, auditory and social aspects. This difference in these aspects may lead to a difference in the quality of the controller&#8217;s situation awareness which may lead to a difference in the efficacy of the controller&#8217;s instructions and advisories, which may lead to a difference in the occurrence of accidents and incidents. However, the relation between the change of the medium and the risk for the air traffic is difficult to assess and would require a great deal of effort, time and experimentation to quantify.</para>
                  <para>Figure 3: Relation between the change of flight strip and the risk</para>
                  <para>(5)There is probably a relation between the change of the flight progress strip medium and the risk for air traffic: a new human&#8211;machine interface may have an effect on the situation awareness of some individual controllers in some circumstances, which might have an effect on whether, when and what instructions are given, and this in turn influences the aircraft movements, and, hence, the risks. The question by what amount risks increase or decrease is very hard to answer.</para>
                  <para>(6)Performing a risk evaluation using actual risk may not be worthwhile due to the difficulties and considerable cost and effort involved in assessing the risk of the change directly. Therefore, the use of proxies might be preferred. A quantity is only considered an appropriate proxy if it satisfies the criteria in point AMC2 ATS.OR.210(a):</para>
                  <para>(i)Causality: The quantity used as proxy can be expected to be influenced by the change, and the risk can be expected to be influenced by the quantity. In addition to this causal relationship, a criterion can be formulated and agreed upon that expresses by which amount the value of the quantity may shift due to the change. Note that the influence of the proxy on the risk cannot easily be quantified, otherwise it might be more beneficial to use risk as a measure and the quantity as an auxiliary function.</para>
                  <para>(ii)Measurability: The influence of the change on the quantity can be assessed before as well as after the change.</para>
                  <para>(iii)Independence: When the proxy selected does not cover all hazards, a set of proxies should be used. Any proxy of that set should be sufficiently isolated from other proxies to be treated independently.</para>
                  <para>ChangeProxyRisk totraffic!?ChangeProxyRisk totraffic!?</para>
                  <para>Figure 4: Relation between proxy and risk</para>
                  <para>(7)There is a relationship between the change and the proxy, and there is a relationship between the proxy and the risk to traffic. The first relationship can be assessed (indicated by the &#8216;!&#8217;), while the second cannot (indicated by the &#8216;?&#8217;). An acceptance criterion is typically formulated for the amount the proxy value might increase or decrease.</para>
                  <para>(8)Proxy 1: Head-down time. The head-down time is a good proxy as it satisfies the conditions of:</para>
                  <para>(i)Causality: It is known that more head-down time leads to a higher risk but there is no well-established or generally accepted statement in literature in terms of: &#8216;x % more head-down time implies y% more accidents&#8217;, not to mention for the specific circumstances of the specific air traffic control tower. The causal relationship indicated in Figure 4 can be established because:</para>
                  <para>(A)the head-down time can be expected to change as the manipulation, writing and reading of digital strips might cost more, or perhaps less, attention and effort than the handling of paper strips;</para>
                  <para>(B)the loss of head-up time of ground and runway controllers implies less surveillance, at least less time for the out-of-the-window-view in good visibility, and this implies a later or less probable detection of conflicts; and</para>
                  <para>(C)an example of an acceptance criterion reads: &#8216;The introduction of the digital strip system does not lead to a significant increase in the head down time&#8217;.</para>
                  <para>(ii)Measurability: The influence of the change on the head-down time can be assessed before the change by means of real-time human-in-the-loop experiments in which controllers are tasked to handle equal amounts of traffic in equal circumstances, one time using paper strips and another time using digital strips. The percentage of head-down time can then be determined by observing the controllers by cameras and eye-trackers.</para>
                  <para>(9)Proxy 2: Fraction of erroneous SID allocations. The fraction of erroneous SID allocations is a good proxy as it satisfies the conditions of:</para>
                  <para>(i)Causality: It can be imagined that an erroneous SID selected in the flight management system (FMS) might lead to accidents, but the precise conditional probability is small and difficult to estimate as it depends on several external factors such as the flight paths of the correct and incorrect SIDs, the presence of other traffic, the timing and geometry of the trajectories, the cloud base or the vigilance of the controller. The causal relationship indicated in Figure 4 can be established because:</para>
                  <para>(A)the number of incorrect SIDs indicated on electronic strips can be expected to be less than on paper strips, because of the possibilities of systematic checks with respect to runway allocation, runway configuration, SID allocation of the predecessor and destination in the flight plan;</para>
                  <para>(B)the allocation of an incorrect SID to an aircrew might lead to a situation in which the aircraft manoeuvres in an unanticipated way, possibly leading to a conflict with another aircraft, for example departing from a parallel runway; and</para>
                  <para>(C)an example of an acceptance criterion reads: &#8216;The introduction of the digital strip system should lead to a decrease of the fraction of erroneous SID allocations of more than 20&#160;%&#8217;.</para>
                  <para>(ii)Measurability: The influence of the change on the fraction of erroneous SID allocations can be assessed before the change by means of an analysis of the causes and occurrences of such errors and the estimated efficacy of the systematic checks. The fractions can be assessed after the change by the statistics of the event reports.</para>
                  <para>(10)Finally, the last condition of independence of proxies is also satisfied. For the purpose of this example, the proxies in (5) and (6) form a set of independent proxies that are complete, i.e. they cover all identified hazards introduced by the replacement of paper strips by a digital strip system.</para>

                <para>When a risk assessment of a set of hazards is executed, in terms of risk:</para>
                <para>(1)the frequency or probability of the occurrence of the hazard should be determined;</para>
                <para>(2)the possible sequences of events from the occurrence of a hazardous event to the occurrence of an accident, which may be referred to as accident trajectories, should be identified.

                <para>(3)the potential harmful effects of the accident, including those resulting from a simultaneous occurrence of a combination of hazards, should be identified;</para>
                <para>(4)the severity of these harmful effects should be assessed, using a defined severity scheme according to point (f) of AMC2 ATS.OR.205(b)(3); and</para>
                <para>(5)the risk of the potential harmful effects of all the accidents, given the occurrence of the hazard, should be determined, taking into account the probabilities that the mitigations may fail as well as succeed, and that particular accident trajectories will be followed when particular contributing factors and circumstances occur.</para>
                <para>(b)Severity schemes</para>
                <para>The severity determination should take place according to a severity classification scheme.</para>
                <para>The purpose of a severity classification scheme is to facilitate the management and control of risk. A severity class is, in effect, a container within which accidents can be placed if their severities are considered similar. Each container can be given a value which represents the consequences, i.e. small for accidents causing little harm and big for accidents causing a lot of harm. The sum of the probabilities of all the accidents assigned to a severity class multiplied by the value that is related to the severity class, is the risk associated with that class. If the value that represents severity for all classes is scalar, then the total risk is the sum of the risks in each severity class.</para>
                <para>(1)Single-risk value severity schemes</para>
                <para>Such schemes use a single severity category to represent harm to humans. Other categories representing other kinds of harm e.g. damage to aircraft and loss of separation, may be present but do not represent harm to humans. In these circumstances, risk analysis would actually be reduced to frequency/probability analysis.</para>
                <para>(2)Multiple-risk value severity schemes</para>
                <para>Multiple-risk value severity schemes, which use a number of severity categories to classify different levels of harm, facilitate the management and control of risk in a number of ways. At the simplest level, the distribution of accidents across the severity classes gives a picture of whether the risk profile of a system is well balanced. For example, many accidents in the top and bottom severity classes with few in between suggests an imbalance in risk, perhaps due to an undue amount of attention having been paid to some types of accident at the expense of others. More detailed management and control of risk includes:</para>
                <para>(i)Severity classes may be used as the basis for reporting accident statistics.</para>
                <para>(ii)Severity classes combined with frequency (or probability) classes can be used to define criteria for decision-making regarding risk acceptance.</para>
                <para>(iii)The total risk associated with one or more severity classes can be managed and controlled. For example, the sum of the risk from all severity classes represents the total risk and may be used as a basis for making decisions about changes.</para>
                <para>(iv)Similarly, the risk associated with accident types of different levels of severity can be compared. For example, comparing runway infringement accidents with low speed taxiway accidents would allow an organisation to focus their efforts on mitigating the accident type with greatest risk.</para>
                <para>(c)The air traffic services provider should coordinate its severity scheme(s) when performing multi-actor changes to ensure adequate assessment. This includes coordination with air traffic services providers outside of the EU.</para>

                <para>(a)Monitoring is intended to maintain confidence in the safety case during operation of the changed functional system. At entry into service, the safety criteria become performance criteria rather than design criteria. Monitoring is, therefore, only applicable following entry into service of the change.</para>
                <para>(b)Monitoring is likely to be of internal parameters of the functional system that provide a good indication of the performance of the service. These parameters may not be directly observable at the service level, i.e. at the interface of the service with the operational context. For example, where a function is provided by multiple redundant resources, the availability of the function will be so high that monitoring it may not be useful. However, monitoring the availability of individual resources, which fail much more often, may be a useful indicator of the performance of the overall function.</para>

                <para>SAFETY CRITERIA IN TERMS OF PROXIES FOR SAFETY RISKS</para>
                <para>(a)In the safety assessment of functional systems, it may not always be possible or desirable to specify safety criteria in terms of quantitative values of risk. Instead, safety criteria may be defined in terms of other measures that are related to risk. These measures are called proxies and they need to meet the requirements for a proxy as stated in AMC2&#160;ATS.OR.210(a). For examples of their use, see GM1 to AMC1&#160;ATS.OR.205(b)(4).</para>
                <para>(b)A proxy is some measurable property that can be used to represent the value of something else. In the safety assessment of functional systems, the value of a proxy may be used as a substitute for a value of risk, providing it meets the requirements for a proxy as stated in AMC2&#160;ATS.OR.210(a). Examples of proxies are the frequency of airspace infringements, runway incursions, false alert rate, head-down time, limited sight, level of situation awareness, fraction of read back errors, reduced vigilance, amount of turbulence, distraction of controller&#8217;s attention, inappropriate pilot behaviour, system availability, information integrity and service continuity.</para>
                <para>An example of the concept of using a different but specific quantity to assess an actually relevant quantity is the transposition/measure of an aircraft&#8217;s altitude which is in terms of barometric pressure or the transposition/measure of an aircraft&#8217;s airspeed which is in terms of dynamic pressure.</para>
                <para>(c)A proxy is a measure of a certain property along the causal trajectory between the hazard/event and the harmful effects of the hazard/event in question (see Figure 5). The causal relationship between the proxy and the accident must be justified in the safety case, i.e. it must satisfy AMC2&#160;ATS.OR.210(a). This means that the accident trajectory must be modelled and analysed such that the causal relationship can be assured but without the need to evaluate the quantitative nature of this relationship. It is assumed that since the proxy lies between the hazard/event and the accident, then there is a quantitative causal relationship between the rate of the hazard/event&#8217;s occurrence and the rate of the proxy&#8217;s occurrence. As a consequence,the variation of values of the proxy correlates with values of the hazards/events rate of occurrence and the value of the rate at which the harmful effects occur, i.e. the accident rate, and this relationship is a monotonically increasing one. This means that when the proxy value, e.g. Proxy1, increases/decreases, the associated risk value of the related accident, e.g. Accident1, increases/decreases accordingly.</para>
                <para>Figure 5: Use of proxies along accident trajectories</para>
                <para>(d)Proxies might be preferred where the extra effort needed to identify, describe and analyse a complete set of sequences of events from the occurrence of a hazard to the occurrence of an accident or incident has no added value in the safety assessment. The intrinsic reasons for the amount of the extra effort are the number of significantly different event sequences, the complexity of some accident scenarios, the existence of many barriers preventing the occurrence of a hazard developing into an accident and the lack of evidence on the probability of some events or the frequency of occurrence of some external circumstances and factors. The usage of proxies might then make the safety assessment more tractable and comprehensible and increase the quality of the risk analysis.</para>
                <para>(e)The main advantages of proxies are the easy recognition of safety issues by operational staff involved in the safety assessment, and the direct focus on the analysis and mitigation of the identified hazards and safety issues introduced or affected by the change.</para>
                <para>(f)The main disadvantage of using proxies is that it is not possible to express risk by a uniform measure. However, the value of the proxy should be measurable.</para>
                <para>(g)For further details on the use of proxies, please refer to GM1 to AMC1&#160;ATS.OR.205(b)(4), which contains two examples to assist in the selection and use of proxies in safety analysis.</para>

                <para>ED Decision 2017/001/R</para>
                <para>EXPLANATION OF THE FUNDAMENTALS OF STRESS</para>
                <para>(a)Introduction</para>
                <para>(1)The job of an air traffic controller is considered to be responsible and demanding, and at times can lead to the experience of high levels of stress. The combination of skills and knowledge required to complete air traffic control tasks is wide. Visual spatial skills, perception, information processing, image and pattern recognition, prioritising, logical problem-solving, application of rules and procedures and decision-making form core skills to which we can add interpersonal communication, teamwork and technical vocabulary usage.</para>
                <para>(2)Air traffic control also requires to constantly adapt to an ever-changing traffic picture and work environment within restricted time constraints. This has the potential to lead to considerable work pressure. In contrast, there may be times when traffic flows are low and controllers experience relatively low levels of activity. For some controllers, this may bring its own kind of stress due to the increased efforts required to maintain vigilance under light traffic load.</para>
                <para>(3)Thus, the work of an air traffic controller has the potential to induce high levels of stress; however, the stress experienced by controllers is always unique to the individual and their interaction with their environment.</para>
                <para>(4)&#8216;Stress&#8217; is a term that is in common use within everyday language and can mean different things to different people depending on the context in which it is used. In lay terms, stress is often used to describe an external pressure experienced by an individual whilst at the same time encompassing the subjective experience of this pressure. Usually the term is used in a negative way. In this sense, the lay use of the term &#8216;stress&#8217; encompasses both the cause and the effect, and this can lead to confusion as to its meaning.</para>
                <para>(b)Technical definitions of stress</para>
                <para>(1)Even in its technical use, the word &#8216;stress&#8217; is sometimes used when the term &#8216;stressor&#8217; (or pressure) would be more appropriate, referring to the cause of a stress experience. Stressors can be internal (cognitive or physical) or external (environmental) to the individual and may be defined as any activity, event or other stimulus that causes the individual to experience stress.</para>
                <para>(2)It is helpful to clarify the way the term &#8216;stress&#8217; and other technical terms are used. For the purposes of this guidance material, stress is defined following the Transactional Model of Stress. This views stress as the outcomes experienced by an individual when faced with a potentially stressful event. The experience of the event as negatively stressful (distress), neutral or positive (eustress) is based on the individual&#8217;s perception of their ability to manage the event. Under this definition, stress is a manifestation in the individual of usually negative effects, which can lead to a decrease in performance and negative health effects.</para>
                <para>(3)A stressor can also act to improve performance when it is a stimulus to increase arousal and improves the outputs of an individual in the short to medium term. Too much arousal paradoxically leads to an inverse effect and subsequent detriment in performance.</para>
                <para>(4)Acute stress is, as its name suggests, episodic and occurring for short periods of time. In most cases, the cause of the stress is eliminated by the air traffic controller taking action to manage the situation leading to stress. High levels of acute stress may lead to hyper-arousal and may leave an air traffic controller feeling exhausted. It is important to identify work situations that lead to this acute stress and manage this within the work schedule.</para>
                <para>(5)Chronic stress differs from acute stress only in that it is ongoing and even low levels of continuous chronic stress can lead to performance degradation and serious health implications, if it is not addressed. Chronic stress is insidious in its nature and a sufferer may become so accustomed to the sensations that they are unaware of the long-term negative effects. Chronic stress commonly leads to a sense of inability to cope.</para>
                <para>(6)Both acute and chronic stresses have the potential to lead individuals into hyper-aroused states which may result in panic where task and skill performance, planning, reasoning and judgement are significantly impaired. In such instances, a well-practised but incorrect action, for that particular circumstance, may be performed when an alternative and more appropriate response is required.</para>
                <para>(7)Chronic stress may result in a condition known as burnout. Burnout is generally identified by the following characteristics: disaffection with the job leading to a decrease in motivation with an associated decrease, perceived or otherwise, in performance.</para>
                <para>(c)Sources of stress</para>
                <para>Broadly speaking, the stress experienced by an air traffic controller at work is a function of their underlying background levels of stress, related to lifestyle, health and well-being, personality, organisational/work environment, levels of satisfaction with life generally, and the acute stress imposed by and operational conditions at any given time. There are three major sources of stress: environmental, work-related, and personal.</para>
                <para>(1)Environmental/physical stressors</para>
                <para>(i)Physical stressors are underlying conditions that can either be internal to the body (e.g. pain, hunger, lack of sleep, exhaustion), or external environmental factors (e.g. noise pollution, overcrowding, excess heat). The common factor among all of these stressors is that they all create a physically uncomfortable environment that can cause stress. Stress is not solely dependent on the intensity of a stimulus, but also on the duration of exposure. For example, a low-pitched but persistent noise can cause as much stress as a sudden loud noise.</para>
                <para>(ii)In the air traffic control room, some common environmental/physical stressors could be:</para>
                <para>(A)uncomfortable temperature;</para>
                <para>(B)cramped workspace;</para>
                <para>(C)air quality;</para>
                <para>(D)lighting conditions; and</para>
                <para>(E)intrusive noise or vibration.</para>
                <para>(2)Work-related stressors</para>
                <para>(i)Stress in the workplace can come from a variety of sources besides physical stimuli. Some of these include:</para>
                <para>(A)continuing high levels of workload near or above the maximum traffic handling capacity of an air traffic controller;</para>
                <para>(B)a heterogeneous traffic mix where aircraft have varying levels of equipment and considerable variability in pilot skills;</para>
                <para>(C)unsuitable or unreliable equipment;</para>
                <para>(D)inappropriate, vague procedures;</para>
                <para>(E)complex equipment which is insufficiently understood or mistrusted;</para>
                <para>(F)supervision of trainees or less experienced colleagues;</para>
                <para>(G)workload and task breakdown not being matched to the level of technical skill of the controller, lack of support or too much support (interference);</para>
                <para>(H)role ambiguity, where it is unclear where the responsibilities lie;</para>
                <para>(I)interpersonal conflict with colleagues, other professionals;</para>
                <para>(J)poor management relations (social dialogue), working conditions, e.g. rostering; and</para>
                <para>(K)unusual or emergency situations.</para>
                <para>(ii)Incidents, including emergencies and accidents, that lead controllers to feel that they are not coping may lead to the experience of critical incident stress; this, in turn, may impair performance in varying degrees.</para>
                <para>(3)Personal stressors</para>
                <para>(i)Personal stressors include the range of events that occur throughout people&#8217;s lives but external to the workplace. The belief that such stressors can be left at home, however, is a myth, and these personal stressors accompany air traffic controllers to work every day.</para>
                <para>(ii)Personal issues such as health, personal life, living situation and major life events (deaths, births, marriages, and moving house) add to the background level of stress that individuals have to cope with. Where these are excessive, they can interfere with work due to the distraction they cause and the mental effort they require to resolve them.</para>
                <para>(iii)Stress is also considered to have a contagious quality, which happens when a stressed person or stressed persons create stressful situations for those around them.</para>
                <para>(d)Signs of stress in the individual</para>
                <para>Signs of stress are many and varied. Some of the most commonly observed are shown below:</para>
                <para>(1)Physiological</para>
                <para>(i)Cardiovascular: increased pulse rate, elevated blood pressure, chest pains;</para>
                <para>(ii)Respiratory: shortness of breath, tightness of chest, hyperventilation, dizziness;</para>
                <para>(iii)Gastrointestinal: loss of appetite, gas pain, abdominal cramps, indigestion, diarrhoea, nausea;</para>
                <para>(iv)Sweaty palms;</para>
                <para>(v)Aching neck, jaw and back muscles;</para>

                <para>Any source of stress has the potential to create unique subjective experiences in different individuals, and these may be positive or negative experiences or something in between.</para>
                <para>(f)Negative experiences of stress</para>
                <para>There is a number of ways in which stress experienced by air traffic controllers can be manifested in the performance of air traffic control tasks. Some of these are listed in Table 1, but, in general terms, performance of tasks decreases due to the detrimental effects that high levels of stress can have on perception, awareness, decision-making and judgement. In&#160;the longer term, health and well-being may also be compromised, leading to decreased performance of air traffic controllers.</para>
                <para>Table 1 below shows the effects on air traffic controller performance which can be linked to stress and which can potentially have very significant implications for the safety performance of an operation.</para>

                <para>(g)Mitigation of stress in the individual and the organisation</para>
                <para>Air traffic control service providers have a duty to take care of their employees and the customers of their services. They should aim at mitigating the negative effects of stress. This is best achieved by ensuring that a range of preventative measures as well as countermeasures are in place. These include:</para>
                <para>(1)adoption of a stress policy and/or a critical incident stress management policy within the organisation;</para>

                <para>Service providers of satellite-based augmentation systems should be considered as CNS providers within the scope of Regulation (EU) 2017/373, hence they should be duly certified. The ESSP has been certified and is overseen by EASA; as such, this provider is obliged to comply with the requirement in ATM/ANS.OR.B.005(f) in Annex III and to conclude appropriate agreements with the air navigation service (including air traffic services) providers concerned. Currently, these arrangements are stipulated in accordance with Section 9.3 of Attachment D to ICAO Annex 10, Volume I. When these arrangements are established, the ESSP provides information on the availability of its services to the relevant air navigation services providers.</para>

                <para>AIR TRAFFIC ADVISORY SERVICE</para>
                <para>(a)The air traffic advisory service within airspace class F should be provided with the objective of making information on collision hazards more effective than it would be in the mere flight information service provision.</para>
                <para>(b)The air traffic advisory service may be provided to aircraft conducting instrument flight rules (IFR) flights in advisory airspace or on advisory routes (class F airspace), specified by the State concerned.</para>
                <para>(c)Air traffic advisory service does not afford the degree of safety and cannot assume the same responsibilities as air traffic control service in respect of the avoidance of collisions, since information regarding the disposition of traffic in the area concerned available to the unit providing air traffic advisory service may be incomplete.</para>
                <para>(d)The efficiency of air traffic advisory service will depend largely on the procedures and practices in use. Its establishment in line with the organisation, procedures and equipment of area control service, taking into account the basic differences of the two services, will help to ensure a high degree of efficiency and promote uniformity in the various provisions of air traffic advisory service. For example, exchange of information by the units concerned on the progress of an aircraft from one advisory area into an adjacent control area or terminal control area (TMA), and vice versa, will help to relieve pilots from repeating details of their flight plans already filed; also, use of standard ATC phraseology, preceded by the verbs &#8216;suggest&#8217; or &#8216;advise&#8217;, will facilitate the pilot&#8217;s understanding of air traffic advisory service intelligence.</para>
                <para>(e)Air traffic services units providing air traffic advisory service:</para>
                <para>(1)advise the aircraft to depart at the time specified and to cruise at the levels indicated in the flight plan if they do not foresee any conflict with other known traffic;</para>
                <para>(2)suggest to aircraft a course of action by which a potential hazard may be avoided, giving priority to an aircraft already in advisory airspace over other aircraft desiring to enter such advisory airspace; and</para>
                <para>(3)pass on to aircraft traffic information comprising the same information as that prescribed for area control service.</para>
                <para>(f)The criteria used as a basis for action under points (e)(2) and (e)(3) should be at least those laid down for aircraft operating in controlled airspace and should take into account the limitations inherent in the provision of air traffic advisory service, navigation facilities and air-ground communications prevailing in the region.</para>

                <para>EXPLANATION FOR THE CONSISTENT NEED FOR THE TERM &#8216;NOMINAL&#8217; IN EU REGULATORY MATERIAL</para>
                <para>(a)Introduction</para>
                <para>ICAO Doc 4444 &#8216;PANS ATM&#8217; Section 5.3.2 stipulates that the &#8216;vertical separation minimum shall be a &#8216;nominal&#8217; 300 m (1 000 ft) below Flight Level 290&#8217;. However, the term &#8216;nominal&#8217; is used inconsistently in ICAO provisions which relate to the vertical separation minimum. An example of such inconsistency may be found in ICAO Doc 7030 &#8216;EUR Regional Supplementary Procedures&#8217; Chapter 6.3.1.2 (transposed with some modifications as point (b) of ATS.TR.130) which states that &#8216;the transition level shall be located at least 300 m (1 000 ft) above the transition altitude to permit the transition altitude and the transition level to be used concurrently in cruising flight, with vertical separation ensured&#8217;.</para>
                <para>In transposing ICAO provisions into the EU regulatory framework, it is considered that consistent descriptions should be used in relation to the determination of the transition level, in order to ensure that the flexibility permitted by ICAO through the use of the term &#8216;nominal&#8217; is maintained.</para>
                <para>(b)History of the vertical separation minimum</para>
                <para>The advent in the early 1950s of commercial turbo jet aircraft operating at high levels necessitated a re-evaluation of the vertical separation minimum and thus, in June 1954, ICAO established the Vertical Separation Minima Panel. Based on the work of this Panel, the use of 1 000 ft vertical separation minimum between IFR traffic below 29 000 ft was agreed by ICAO at the 1958 RAC/SAR Divisional Meeting and incorporated within PANS ATM Section 5.3.2 as highlighted above.</para>
                <para>Although ICAO does not define &#8216;nominal&#8217;, when transposing ICAO provisions into EU legislation, it is necessary to have clear and consistent understanding of the terms in relation to the establishment of a transition level. Accordingly, the Agency notes the following factors relating to the use of the term &#8216;nominal&#8217;:</para>
                <para>(1)300 m is equal to 984.3 ft, whilst 1 000ft is equal to 304.8 m;</para>
                <para>(2)the vertical distance between flights at two altitudes or two flight levels, for example FL 090 and FL 100, will only be 300 m (1 000 ft) under conditions where the ICAO Standard Atmosphere (ISA) &#8212; ICAO Doc 7488 &#8216;Manual of the ICAO Standard Atmosphere&#8217; prevails. When conditions in the atmosphere differ from the ICAO ISA, the vertical distance will be greater/less than 300 m (1 000 ft) respectively.</para>
                <para>Moreover, in addition to the equivalence between 300 m and 1 000 ft, other factors including variances between aircraft altimeter settings, aircraft total vertical error (TVE) and the dimensions of an aircraft above and below its static pressure source are encompassed within the term &#8216;nominal&#8217;.</para>
                <para>(c)Determination of the transition level</para>
                <para>The transition level is a function of the transition altitude of the aerodrome concerned and the difference between the aerodrome QNH altimeter setting value and the standard pressure setting. Regarding the relationship between pressure and height, the following is to be noted:</para>
                <para>(1)The relationship between height and pressure is non-linear. The specification of the ISA is set out in ICAO Doc 7488 &#8216;Manual of the ICAO Standard Atmosphere&#8217;.</para>
                <para>(2)The real atmosphere is rarely consistent with the ISA. Consequently, variations in the conditions specified in the ISA generate differences in the vertical distances between surfaces of equal atmospheric pressure, dependent upon an aircraft&#8217;s level within a particular column of air.</para>
                <para>(3)Altimeters are calibrated against the ISA as defined in ICAO Doc 7488.</para>
                <para>(4)The standard pressure setting is 1013.25 hPa as defined in ICAO Doc 7488.</para>
                <para>In those instances where an aerodrome QNH of 1 013 hPa exists, a vertical difference of 6.8 ft exists between 1 013 hPa and 1 013.25 hPa (equivalent to a vertical distance of 27.3 ft per 1 hPa at mean sea level in accordance with the ISA). Where a transition altitude of 6 000 ft exists, this would result in a transition level of FL 75 as detailed below:</para>
                <para>(1)Transition altitude 6 000 ft + 1 000 ft (ICAO Doc 7030 EUR Chapter 6.3.1.2) = 7 000 ft</para>
                <para>(2)(1 013.25 hPa &#8211; 1 013 hPa) x 27.3 ft = 6.825 ft = 7 ft</para>
                <para>(3)Transition level = 7 000 ft + 7 ft rounded up to nearest 500 ft increment = FL 75</para>
                <para>Consequently, in those instances when the reported aerodrome QNH is 1 013 hPa, a flight level is &#8216;lost&#8217; through the need to &#8216;round up&#8217; by 493 ft; thus providing a vertical separation of 1 493 ft between aircraft cruising concurrently at the transition altitude and the transition level. In high-density/high-complexity airspace, the loss of airspace capacity that this represents, coupled with the second order effect of increased controller workload, is considered to have a significant impact by industry.</para>
                <para>Through the application of a vertical separation minimum of 300 m and considering the &#8216;nominal&#8217; equivalence between 300 m and 1 000 ft, ICAO implicitly endorses a vertical separation of only 984.3 ft. Continuing the example given above, the inclusion of the term &#8216;nominal&#8217; would permit the transition level to be FL 70, resulting in a vertical separation of 993 ft between aircraft cruising concurrently at the transition altitude and the transition level; a value which remains within the 300 m/984.3 ft equivalence. In this instance, the practical safety effect of a 7 ft reduction in the vertical distance between aircraft is considered to be operationally insignificant.</para>

                <para>(i)by correlating a particular radar position indication with an aircraft reporting its position over, or as bearing and distance from, a point shown on the situation display, and by ascertaining that the track of the particular radar position is consistent with the aircraft path or reported heading;</para>
                <para>(ii)by correlating an observed radar position indication with an aircraft which is known to have just departed, provided that the identification is established within 2 km (1 NM) from the end of the runway used. Particular care should be taken to avoid confusion with aircraft holding over or overflying the aerodrome, or with aircraft departing from or making a missed approach over adjacent runways;</para>

                <para>(iv)when air traffic control service is provided, by ascertaining the aircraft heading, if circumstances require, and following a period of track observation:</para>

                <para>(2)When using these methods, the air traffic controller/FIS officer/AFIS officer, as appropriate, should:</para>
                <para>(i)verify that the movements of not more than one radar position indication correspond with those of the aircraft; and</para>
                <para>(ii)ensure that the manoeuvre(s) will not carry the aircraft outside the coverage of the radar or the situation display.</para>
                <para>(d)Additional identification method</para>
                <para>When two or more position indications are observed in close proximity, or are observed to be making similar movements at the same time, or when doubt exists as to the identity of a position indication for any other reason, the identification procedure in point (c)(1)(iv) should be used (only in case of air traffic control service provision), or additional methods of identification should be employed, until all risk of error in identification is eliminated.</para>

                  <para>(a)When applying the identification method described in point (b)(6) of AMC3 ATS.TR.155(c)(1), attention is to be paid to any errors which might occur due to parallax effects.</para>
                  <para>(b)When applying the identification method described in point (b)(7) of AMC3 ATS.TR.155(c)(1), caution is to be exercised before transferring identification using this method, particularly if other position indications are observed on similar headings and in close proximity to the aircraft to which air traffic services are provided. Inherent radar deficiencies, such as inaccuracies in bearing and distance of the radar position indications displayed on individual situation displays and parallax errors, may cause the indicated position of an aircraft in relation to the known point to differ between the two situation displays. The air traffic services provider may therefore prescribe additional conditions for the application of this method, e.g.:</para>
                  <para>(1)a maximum distance from the common reference point used by the affected air traffic controller(s)/FIS officer(s)/AFIS officer(s), as applicable; and</para>
                  <para>(2)a maximum distance between the position indication as observed by the accepting air traffic controller/FIS officer/AFIS officer and the one stated by the transferring air traffic controller/FIS officer/AFIS officer.</para>
                  <para>(c)The use of procedures in points (b)(8) and (b)(9) of AMC3 ATS.TR.155(c)(1) requires prior coordination between the air traffic controllers/FIS officers/AFIS officers, since the indications to be observed by the accepting air traffic controller/FIS officer/AFIS officer are of short duration.</para>

                  <para>(a)The air traffic controller should issue the clearance for the approach prior to the time the aircraft reports are established unless circumstances preclude the issuance of the clearance at such time. Vectoring will normally terminate at the time the aircraft leaves the last assigned heading to intercept the final approach track.</para>
                  <para>(b)When clearance for the approach is issued, the aircraft is expected to maintain the last assigned level until intercepting the specified or nominal glide path of the approach procedure. If the air traffic controller requires an aircraft to intercept the glide path at a level other than a level flight segment depicted on the instrument approach chart, the air traffic controller should instruct the pilot to maintain the particular level until established on the glide path.</para>
                  <para>(c)The approach air traffic controller is normally responsible for maintaining separation based on ATS surveillance systems between succeeding aircraft on the same final approach, except that the responsibility may be transferred to the aerodrome air traffic controller in accordance with procedures prescribed by the air traffic services provider, and provided an ATS surveillance system is available to the aerodrome air traffic controller.</para>

                  <para>(d)When a radar approach cannot be continued due to any circumstance, the aircraft should be immediately informed that a radar approach or continuation thereof is not possible. The approach should be continued if this is possible using non-radar facilities or if the pilot reports that the approach can be completed visually; otherwise, an alternative clearance should be given.</para>
                  <para>(e)Aircraft making a radar approach should be reminded, when on final approach, to check that the wheels are down and locked.</para>

                <para>(a)In accordance with AMC1 ATS.TR.155(f), the criterion which should be used to determine that a specific level is occupied by an aircraft should be &#177;60 m (&#177;200 ft) in RVSM airspace. In other airspace, this criterion should be &#177;90 m (&#177;300 ft), except that the competent authority may specify a smaller criterion, but not less than &#177;60 m (&#177;200 ft), if this is found to be more practical.</para>

                <para>SPECIAL AND ALTERNATIVE CONDITIONS AND OPERATING PROCEDURES FOR AIR TRAFFIC SERVICES PROVIDERS PROVIDING SERVICES TO FLIGHT TESTS</para>
                <para>(a)While flight tests are regularly conducted in compliance with the standards and the provisions specified in Subpart B of Annex IV, some of them need to follow specific additional or alternative conditions and procedures approved by the competent authority to meet the needs of flight tests carried out during the flight. This is also the case for flight tests involving more than one aircraft in the same flight test. These special provisions will not jeopardise the safety of the other airspace users and the population in the area overflown.</para>
                <para>(b)In order to ensure safe operations within the provision of air traffic service for flight tests control, the air traffic controllers, FIS officers and AFIS officers providing these services may need to have specific knowledge of flight tests and/or be briefed, depending on the specificities of the flight profiles.</para>
                <para>(c)Air traffic controllers that provide air traffic services to flight tests (flight test air traffic controllers) may need to obtain their specific competence through a dedicated training as specified in Commission Regulation (EU) 2015/340.</para>
                <para>(d)Air traffic services for flight tests should be provided through dedicated and specific procedures. These procedures should address the following:</para>
                <para>(1) Compatibility with other airspace users</para>
                <para>(i) In order to ensure the compatibility of the flight test with other airspace users and to ensure safe operations and an acceptable rate of success of the flight test, the air traffic services provider should ensure proper coordination at all levels, including strategic, pre-tactical and real-time coordination.</para>
                <para>(ii) The air traffic services unit providing services to flight tests is responsible for ensuring compatibility of their activities with other airspace users.</para>
                <para>(2) Flight plan</para>
                <para>The air traffic services unit should obtain all the necessary details related to flight tests (e.g. from the design organisation or the entity wishing to carry out the flight test).</para>
                <para>(3) Flight tests with limited manoeuvrability</para>
                <para>(i)During certain phases of the flight test, the capability to normally perform manoeuvres may only be possible after a necessary period of time (e.g. for the flight crew to get into a configuration that allows the execution of these manoeuvres).</para>
                <para>(ii)The air traffic services provider should obtain the necessary information about the phases of flight and the duration if known.</para>
                <para>(iii)For the conduct of these flights, the use of a temporarily reserved area is preferred. If unable, after prior coordination with the relevant air traffic services units neighbouring the flight tests, the use of a transponder should be mandated.</para>
                <para>(iv)The real-time information on the development of the flight test as described in points (i)(ii)(iii) above does not relieve the air traffic services unit responsible for providing services to the flight tests from the obligation, when applicable, to ensure traffic separation and assure compatibility with all airspace users.</para>
                <para>(e)The above-mentioned procedures are not exhaustive and additional provisions may be necessary to meet the needs of flight tests. The paramount principle is anyhow to make provisions without contradicting the standards and the provisions specified in Subpart B of Annex IV.</para>

                  <para>(a)In order to establish a desired spacing between two or more successive aircraft, the air traffic controller should first either reduce the speed of the last aircraft, or increase the speed of the leading aircraft, then adjust the speed(s) of the other aircraft in order.</para>
                  <para>(b)In order to maintain a desired spacing using speed control techniques, specific speeds need to be assigned to all the aircraft concerned.</para>
                  <para>(c)The true airspeed (TAS) of an aircraft will decrease during descent when maintaining a constant IAS. When two descending aircraft maintain the same IAS, and the leading aircraft is at the lower level, the TAS of the leading aircraft will be lower than that of the following aircraft. The distance between the two aircraft will thus be reduced unless a sufficient speed differential is applied. For the purpose of calculating a desired speed differential between two succeeding aircraft, 11 km/h (6 kt) IAS per 300 m (1 000 ft) height difference may be used as a general rule. At levels below 2 450 m (FL 80), the difference between IAS and TAS is negligible for speed control purposes.</para>
                  <para>(d)The time and distance required to achieve a desired spacing will increase with higher levels, higher speeds, and when the aircraft is in a clean configuration (see point (b) of GM1to AMC2 ATS.TR.210(a)(3))).</para>

                  <para>(1)The following procedure should be utilised as necessary to expedite the approaches of a number of arriving aircraft:</para>
                  <para>(i)a suitable point on the approach path, which shall be capable of being accurately determined by the pilot, should be specified, to serve as a checkpoint in timing successive approaches;</para>
                  <para>(ii)aircraft should be given a time at which to pass the specified point inbound, which time should be determined with the aim of achieving the desired interval between successive landings on the runway while respecting the applicable separation minima at all times, including the period of runway occupancy.</para>
                  <para>(2)The time at which aircraft shall pass the specified point should be determined by the unit providing approach control service and notified to the aircraft sufficiently in advance to permit the pilot to arrange the flight path accordingly.</para>
                  <para>(3)Each aircraft in the approach sequence should be cleared to pass the specified point inbound at the previously notified time, or any revision thereof, after the preceding aircraft has reported passing the point inbound.</para>
                  <para>(b)Interval between successive approaches</para>
                  <para>In determining the time interval or longitudinal distance to be applied between successive approaching aircraft, the relative speeds between succeeding aircraft, the distance from the specified point to the runway, the need to apply wake turbulence separation, runway occupancy times, the prevailing meteorological conditions as well as any condition which may affect runway occupancy times should be considered. When an ATS surveillance system is used to establish an approach sequence, the minimum distance to be established between succeeding aircraft should be specified in local instructions. Local instructions should additionally specify the circumstances under which any increased longitudinal distance between approaches may be required as well as the minima to be used under such circumstances.</para>

                <para>(a)Prior to issuing a taxi clearance, the air traffic controller should determine where the aircraft concerned is parked. Taxi clearances should contain concise instructions and adequate information so as to assist the flight crew in following the correct taxi routes, in avoiding collision with other aircraft or objects and in minimising the potential for the aircraft inadvertently entering an active runway.</para>
                <para>(b)When a taxi clearance contains a taxi limit beyond a runway, it should contain an explicit clearance to cross or an instruction to hold short of that runway at a corresponding holding point.</para>

Where control of taxiing aircraft is provided by a ground air traffic controller and the control of runway operations by an aerodrome air traffic controller, a clearance to taxi on the runway-in-use should be issued by the aerodrome air traffic controller once direct two-way communications between the pilot and the aerodrome air traffic controller have been established. Any subsequent instruction to change frequency should be issued by the aerodrome air traffic controller to the taxiing aircraft after it has vacated the runway.</para>
                <para>(b)If the aerodrome air traffic controller is unable to determine, either visually or via an ATS surveillance system, that a vacating or crossing aircraft has cleared the runway, the aircraft should be requested to report when it has vacated the runway. The report should be made when the entire aircraft is beyond the relevant runway-holding position.</para>

In addition, an aborted take-off or a go-around executed after touchdown may expose the aeroplane to the risk of overrunning the runway. Moreover, a low-altitude missed approach may expose the aeroplane to the risk of a tail strike. Pilots may therefore have to exercise their judgement, in accordance with SERA.2015 in Regulation (EU) No 923/2012, concerning the authority of the pilot-in-command of an aircraft.</para>

                  <para>(a)If a take-off clearance has to be cancelled before the take-off run has commenced, the pilot should be instructed to hold position and to acknowledge the instruction.</para>
                  <para>(b)In certain circumstances, the aerodrome air traffic controller may consider that it is necessary to cancel a take-off clearance after the aircraft has commenced the take-off run. In this event, the pilot should be instructed to stop immediately and to acknowledge the instruction.</para>
                  <para>(c)The cancellation of a take-off clearance after an aircraft has commenced its take-off run should only occur when the aircraft will be in serious and imminent danger should it continue. Air traffic controllers should be aware of the potential for an aircraft to overrun the end of the runway if the take-off is abandoned at a late stage; this is particularly so with large aircraft or those operating close to their performance limit, such as at maximum take-off mass, in high ambient temperatures or when the runway braking action may be adversely affected. Because of this risk, even if a take-off clearance is cancelled, the pilot-in-command may consider it safer to continue the take-off than to attempt to stop the aircraft.</para>
                  <para>(d)Air traffic controllers should also be aware of the possibility that an aircraft that abandons its take-off may suffer overheated brakes or another abnormal situation and should be prepared to declare the appropriate category of emergency or to provide other suitable assistance.</para>

                <para>(b)It is axiomatic that a VFR flight must remain in VMC at all times. Accordingly, the issuance of a clearance to a VFR flight to fly subject to maintaining own separation and remaining in VMC has no other object than to signify that, for the duration of the clearance, separation from other aircraft by air traffic control unit is not provided.</para>
                <para>(c)It should be noted that the objectives of the air traffic control service as prescribed in ATS.TR.100 do not include prevention of collision with terrain. Pilots are responsible for ensuring that any clearances issued by air traffic control units are safe in this respect. When vectoring or assigning a direct routing not included in the flight plan, which takes an IFR flight off published ATS route or instrument procedure, the procedures in point (a)(5) of ATS.TR.235 apply.</para>

                <para>(a)Longitudinal separation should be applied so that the spacing between the estimated positions of the aircraft being separated is never less than a prescribed minimum. Longitudinal separation between aircraft following the same or diverging tracks may be maintained by application of speed control, including the Mach number technique. When applicable, use of the Mach number technique should be prescribed on the basis of a regional air navigation agreement.</para>
                <para>(b)Longitudinal separation between supersonic aircraft during the transonic acceleration and supersonic phases of flight should normally be established by appropriate timing of the start of transonic acceleration rather than by the imposition of speed restrictions in supersonic flight.</para>

                <para>(a)Lateral separation should be applied so that the distance between those portions of the intended routes for which the aircraft are to be laterally separated is never less than an established distance to account for navigational inaccuracies plus a specified buffer. This buffer should be determined by the air traffic services provider and approved by the competent authority and included in the lateral separation minima as an integral part thereof.</para>
                <para>(b)Lateral separation of aircraft is obtained by requiring operation on different routes or in different geographical locations as determined by visual observation, by the use of navigation aids or by the use of RNAV equipment.</para>
                <para>(c)Where a route flown by an aircraft involves a specified turn which will result in the minimum lateral separation being infringed, another type of separation or another minimum shall be established prior to the aircraft commencing the turn (see Figures 41 and 42).</para>
                <para>(d)For flyover waypoints, aircraft are required to first fly over the waypoint before executing the turn. After the turn, the aircraft may either navigate to join the route immediately after the turn or navigate to the next defined waypoint before rejoining the route. This will require additional lateral separation on the overflown side of the turn (See Figure 41).</para>

                <para>(a)If the flying time from the departure aerodrome of an aircraft to the boundary of an adjacent control area is less than the specified minimum required to permit transmission of the necessary flight plan and control information to the accepting control unit after take-off and to allow adequate time for reception, analysis and coordination, the transferring control unit should, prior to departure, forward that information to the accepting control unit together with a request for approval. The required time period should be specified in letters of agreement or local instructions, as appropriate. In the case of revisions to a previously transmitted current flight plan, and control data being transmitted earlier than this specified time period, no approval from the accepting control unit should be required.</para>
                <para>(b)In the case of an aircraft in flight requiring an initial clearance when the flying time to the boundary of an adjacent control area is less than a specified minimum, the aircraft should be held within the transferring air traffic control unit&#8217;s control area until the flight plan and control information have been forwarded together with a request for approval, and coordination effected with the adjacent air traffic control unit.</para>
                <para>(c)In the case of an aircraft requesting a change in its current flight plan, or of a transferring air traffic control unit proposing to change the current flight plan of an aircraft, and the flying time of the aircraft to the control area boundary is less than a specified minimum, the revised clearance should be withheld pending approval of the proposal by the adjacent air traffic control unit.</para>
                <para>(d)When boundary estimate data is to be transmitted for approval by the accepting control unit, the time in respect of an aircraft not yet departed should be based on the estimated time of departure as determined by the air traffic control unit in whose area of responsibility the departure aerodrome is located. In respect of an aircraft in flight requiring an initial clearance, the time should be based on the estimated elapsed time from the holding fix to the boundary plus the time expected to be needed for coordination.</para>

                  <para>(a)Clearances for departing aircraft may specify a cleared level other than that indicated in the filed flight plan for the en-route phase of flight, without a time or geographical limit for the cleared level. Such clearances will normally be used to facilitate the application of tactical control methods by air traffic control units, normally through the use of an ATS surveillance system.</para>
                  <para>(b)Where clearances for departing aircraft which contain no time or geographical limit for a cleared level are utilised, the action to be taken by an aircraft experiencing air-ground communication failure in the event that the aircraft has been radar-vectored away from the route specified in its current flight plan, should be prescribed on the basis of a regional air navigation agreement and included in the SID description or published in AIPs.</para>

                  <para>(a)When prior coordination has been effected with units under whose control the aircraft will subsequently come, or if there is reasonable assurance that it can be effected a reasonable time prior to their assumption of control, the clearance limit should be the destination aerodrome or, if not practicable, an appropriate intermediate point, and coordination should be expedited so that a clearance to the destination aerodrome may be issued as soon as possible.</para>

                <para>(a)Except when traffic conditions and coordination procedures permit authorisation of cruise climb, an air traffic control unit should normally authorise only one level for an aircraft beyond its control area, i.e. that level at which the aircraft will enter the next control area whether contiguous or not. It is the responsibility of the accepting control unit to issue clearance for further climb as appropriate. When relevant, aircraft will be advised to request en-route any cruising level changes desired.</para>
                <para>(b)In so far as practicable, cruising levels of aircraft flying to the same destination should be assigned in a manner that will be correct for an approach sequence at destination.</para>
                <para>(c)An aircraft at a cruising level should normally have priority over other aircraft requesting that cruising level. When two or more aircraft are at the same cruising level, the preceding aircraft should normally have priority.</para>

                  <para>With reference to point (l) of AMC2 ATS.TR.255:</para>
                  <para>(a)Independent operations on parallel runways can only be conducted if there are means to ensure that the objectives of the air traffic services would be fulfilled in a manner similar to what the application of separation minima (vertical or horizontal) would achieve.</para>
                  <para>(b)Considering the geometry of two aircraft operating simultaneously on the parallel runways, while longitudinal separation is applied between aircraft approaching the same runway, a lateral separation is needed between the aircraft operating on parallel approaches for the most critical scenario: two aircraft at the same time on each final approach.</para>
                  <para>(c)To provide the acceptable lateral separation in such circumstances, an NTZ is established. The NTZ is considered to provide the lateral separation from the moment vertical separation between aircraft on adjacent approaches no longer exists until aircraft have landed. The responsibility of air traffic controllers is to closely monitor the progress of the flights and to immediately react when an aircraft deviates towards the NTZ boundary.</para>
                  <para>(d)In that sense, the tasks of these air traffic controllers (referred to as &#8216;monitoring controllers&#8217;), are as follows:</para>
                  <para>(1)to ensure that the NTZ is not penetrated when vertical separation is reduced;</para>
                  <para>(2)to instruct aircraft observed to overshoot the turn-on or to continue on a track which will penetrate the NTZ to return immediately to the correct track;</para>
                  <para>(3)to ensure that the applicable minimum longitudinal separation between aircraft on the same final approach course or track is maintained;</para>
                  <para>(4)if no dedicated radio channels are available for the monitoring controllers to control aircraft until landing, to transfer communication with the aircraft to the respective channel of the aerodrome air traffic controller before either of the two aircraft on adjacent final approach tracks intercepts the glide path or vertical path for the selected instrument approach procedure. In this case, the controllers monitoring the approaches to each runway are provided with the capability to override transmissions of aerodrome control on the respective radio channels for each arrival flow;</para>
                  <para>(5)if dedicated radio channels are available for the monitoring controllers to relay the landing clearances received from the aerodrome air traffic controller, or when the aerodrome air traffic controller informs that visual separation can be applied, to transfer the communications to the aerodrome air traffic controller;</para>
                  <para>(6)when an aircraft is observed penetrating the NTZ, to instruct the aircraft on the adjacent final approach course or track to immediately climb and turn to an assigned altitude/height and heading (break-out procedures) in order to avoid the deviating aircraft. Where PAOAS criteria are applied for the obstacle assessment, the monitoring controller will not issue the heading instruction to the aircraft below 120 m (400 ft) above the runway threshold elevation, and the heading instruction will not exceed 45 degrees track difference with the final approach course or track; and</para>
                  <para>(7)to terminatemonitoring when either:</para>
                  <para>(i)visual separation is applied provided that procedures ensure that both monitoring controllers are advised whenever visual separation is applied; or</para>
                  <para>(ii)the aircraft has landed or, in case of a missed approach, is at least 1 NM beyond the departure end of the runway and adequate separation with other traffic is established.</para>
                  <para>(e)When there is a large deviation from the final approach track, communication between the controllers and pilots involved is critical. For independent parallel approaches, monitoring controllers are required, for each runway, with separate control frequencies. The monitoring controller(s) can transmit on either of these frequencies, automatically overriding transmissions by the other aerodrome air traffic controllers, or can use dedicated radio channels, if available. It is essential that a check of the override capability at each monitor position be performed prior to the monitoring controllers assuming responsibility of the position. The air traffic services provider should take steps to ensure that, in the event of a deviation, the monitoring controller will be able to contact the deviating aircraft and the endangered aircraft immediately. This will involve studying the proportion of time during which communications are blocked.</para>
                  <para>(f)Monitoring of approaches to no more than two runways by a single monitoring controller may be permitted if determined by a safety assessment and approved by the competent authority, as described below.</para>
                  <para>(g)During simultaneous independent approach operations, participating aircraft are established on guidance to instrument approach procedures which have been designed to not interfere with one another. By remaining on their guidance, the aircraft are, by design, not threats to each other, and are considered separated. If either aircraft deviates from its lateral path defined by its assigned instrument approach, separation is no longer assured. To protect against operational errors, system or equipment failures, etc., Simultaneous Operations on Parallel or Near-Parallel Instrument Runways (SOIR) procedures require the monitoring controller to provide intervention as necessary. Monitoring controllers are required to identify and respond to such traffic transgressions in a timely manner to protect proximate traffic and minimise collision risk. Their responsibility is to recognise a deviation from a cleared lateral path, determine a manoeuvre for any nearby traffic that might be threatened by this deviation that will avoid a collision, and transmit this manoeuvre instruction to the threatened aircraft. If there is no threatened traffic, or after the threatened traffic has begun its escape manoeuvre, the monitoring controller will also attempt to instruct the deviating aircraft.</para>
                  <para>(h)The time budgeted for recognition by monitoring controller of potential collision during non-nominal events in simultaneous parallel approaches is in the order of seconds. System-generated alerts to the monitoring controller that can differentiate quickly and accurately between normal and non-nominal situations will be an enabling element of the operation. The region known as NTZ is used to provide air traffic controllers with time to identify that one aircraft on a simultaneous approach may threaten the other and to then take appropriate action to avoid a collision. Normally, a dedicated monitoring controller is assigned to each approach during simultaneous operations. However, since a single NTZ is defined in the space between simultaneous approaches, it may be possible for a single controller to effectively monitor and correct any transgressing aircraft. Approval of an alternate to the otherwise-required approach-specific monitor control positions should consider, as a minimum, the following elements unique to a specific approach pairing:</para>

                  <para>(a)Essential information on aerodrome conditions is information necessary to safety in the operation of aircraft, which pertains to the movement area or any facilities usually associated therewith. For example, construction work on a taxi strip not connected to the runway-in-use would not be essential information to any aircraft except one that might be taxied in the vicinity of the construction work. As another example, if all traffic must be confined to runways, that fact should be considered as essential aerodrome information to any aircraft not familiar with the aerodrome.</para>
                  <para>(b)Essential information on aerodrome conditions should include information relating to the following:</para>
                  <para>(1)construction or maintenance work on, or immediately adjacent to, the movement area;</para>
                  <para>(2)rough or broken surfaces on a runway, a taxiway or an apron, whether marked or not;</para>
                  <para>(3)water, snow, slush, ice or frost on a runway, a taxiway or an apron;</para>
                  <para>(4)anti-icing or de-icing liquid chemicals or other contaminants on a runway, taxiway or apron;</para>
                  <para>(5)other temporary hazards, including parked aircraft and birds on the ground or in the air;</para>
                  <para>(6)failure or irregular operation of part or all of the aerodrome lighting system; and</para>
                  <para>(7)any other pertinent information.</para>
                  <para>(c)Up-to-date information on the conditions on aprons may not always be available to the aerodrome control tower or to the AFIS unit. The responsibility of the aerodrome control tower or the AFIS unit in relation to aprons is, with respect to the provision of information as described in points (a) and (b), limited to the transmission to aircraft of the information which is provided to it by the operator responsible for the aprons.</para>

                  <para>Instrumented systems based on transmissometer or forward-scatter meters must be used to assess RVR on runways intended for Categories II and III instrument approach and landing operations. For Category I instrument approach, other means to assess RVR exist and the assessment of RVR by means of instrumented systems based on transmissometer or forward-scatter meters are therefore not required. However, if the competent authority considers that an instrument system is required at certain aerodromes, it may decide so. Therefore, the requirement in MET.TR.210(c)(2) provides this option, which is consistent with the ICAO Annex 3 approach.</para>

The issuance of forecasts of upper wind and upper-air temperature at an altitude of 2&#160;000&#160;ft (600&#160;m) may be subject to local orographic considerations as determined by the competent authority.</para>
                <para>(b)When chart form is used for area forecasts for low-level flights, the forecast of SIGWX phenomena shall be issued as low-level SIGWX forecast for flight levels up to 100, or up to flight level 150 in mountainous areas, or higher, where necessary. Low-level SIGWX forecasts shall include:</para>
                <para>(1)the following phenomena warranting the issuance of a SIGMET: severe icing, severe turbulence, cumulonimbus clouds and thunderstorms that are obscured, frequent, embedded or occurring at a squall line, sandstorms/dust storms and volcanic eruptions or a release of radioactive materials into the atmosphere, and which are expected to affect low-level flights;</para>
                <para>(2)the following elements in area forecasts for low-level flights: surface wind, surface visibility, significant weather phenomena, mountain obscuration, cloud, icing, turbulence, mountain wave and height of zero-degree isotherm.</para>

                  <para>(b)When low-level forecast is issued as a SIGWX chart or as a wind and temperature (W+T) chart, it should, as appropriate, include the cloud/visibility information in the form of visibility/cloud base category which should be provided for well-defined sub-areas and/or route segments. For each sub-area and/or route segment, the reference height to which the cloud base information refers should be specified.</para>
                  <para>(c)The graphical part of a SIGWX chart should depict the weather situation at the beginning of the validity period. Significant changes of initial weather parameters should be depicted together with time intervals determining the duration of expected changes.</para>

                <para>GENERAL</para>
                <para>(a)Validation</para>
                <para>Validation is the activity where a data element is checked as having a value that is fully applicable to the identity ascribed to the data element, or a set of data elements is checked as being acceptable for their intended use.</para>
                <para>The application of validation techniques considers the entire aeronautical data chain. This includes the validation performed by prior data chain participants and any requirements levied on the data supplier. Providing data integrity has been assured, there is no need to repeat earlier validations as a matter of course.</para>
                <para>Examples of validation techniques include the following:</para>
                <para>(1)Validation by application validates by applying data under test conditions. In certain cases, this may not be practical. Validation by application is considered to be the most effective form of validation. For example, flight inspection of final approach segment data prior to publication can be used to ensure that the published data is acceptable.</para>
                <para>(2)Logical consistency validates by comparing two different data sets or elements and identifying inconsistencies between values based on operative rules (e.g. business rules).</para>
                <para>(3)Semantic consistency validates by comparing data to an expected value or range of values for the data characteristics.</para>
                <para>(4)Validation by sampling evaluates a representative sample of data and applies statistical analysis to determine the confidence in the data quality.</para>
                <para>(b)Verification</para>
                <para>Verification is a process for checking the integrity of a data element whereby the data element is compared to another source, either from a different process or from a different point in the same process. While verification cannot ensure that the data is correct, it can be effective to ensure that the data has not been corrupted by the data process.</para>
                <para>The application of verification techniques considers only the portion of the aeronautical data chain controlled by the organisation. Yet, verification techniques may be applied at multiple phases of the data processing chain.</para>
                <para>Examples of verification techniques include the following:</para>
                <para>(1)Feedback testing is the comparison of a data set between its output and input state.</para>
                <para>(2)Independent redundancy testing involves processing the same data through two or more independent processes and comparing the data output of each process.</para>
                <para>(3)Update comparison involves comparison of updated data with its previous version. This comparison can identify all data elements that have changed. The list of changed elements can then be compared to a similar list generated by the supplier. A problem can be detected if an element is identified as changed on one list and not on the other.</para>

                <para>(b)Stating that resolution needs to be commensurate with the accuracy means that digital data needs to have sufficient resolution to maintain accuracy. Typically, if an accuracy of .1 units is needed, then a resolution of 0.01 or .001 units would enable a data chain to preserve the accuracy without problems. A finer resolution could be misleading as one could assume that it supports a finer accuracy. This factor range of 10 to 100 between accuracy and resolution is applicable regardless of the units of measurements used.</para>

                <para>(c)The AIP section GEN 1.7 is used to identify non-compliant aeronautical data items. A new sub-header should be introduced at the end of the current section named &#8216;Data non-compliant with European Commission Regulation (EU) 2017/373&#8217;.</para>
                <para>(d)Within AIP GEN 1.7, the following two alternatives are proposed. The choice of which depends on national practicalities being based either on the amount of annotations to be published or on individual existing operational or technical constraints.</para>
                <para>(1)Annotation alternative 1</para>
                <para>Alternative 1 is recommended if the number of identified non-compliances covers no more than two AIP pages.</para>
                <para>The relevant non-compliant data items shall be listed in a table, including as a minimum:</para>
                <para>&#8212;specific data item;</para>
                <para>&#8212;AIP section(s) concerned;</para>

                <para>&#8212;Notes/remarks.</para>
                <para>Proposed table format:</para>
                <para>(2)Annotation alternative 2</para>
                <para>Alternative 2 is recommended if the number of non-compliances extends more than two AIP pages. It should then contain a general (global) statement to indicate &#8216;Several data items are not compliant with the given regulation &#8211; details can be found online via &lt;link&gt;&#8217;. The link shall direct the user to a list on the website which must support compliance with minimum requirements: the list must be accessible online.</para>
                <para>Note: The indication of &#8216;available on request&#8217;, or similar, is clearly insufficient. The list must be kept up to date and fully synchronised (consistent) with the AIP update cycles, as relevant. This list should be in the form of a table as indicated under alternative 1 noting that it will be made available to users as an extra element outside the AIP.</para>

            <para>The latitude and longitude accurate to one minute, as well as a three-digit distance figure giving the radius of influence in NM (e.g. 4700N01140E043). Coordinates present the approximate centre of circle whose radius encompasses the whole area of influence, and if the NOTAM affects the entire FIR/UIR or more than one FIR/UIR, enter the default value &#8216;999&#8217; for radius.</para>
            <para>4.Item A</para>
            <para>Insert the ICAO location indicator as contained in ICAO Doc 7910 of the aerodrome or FIR in which the facility, airspace, or condition being reported on is located. More than one FIR/UIR may be indicated, when appropriate.

            <para>5.Item B</para>
            <para>For date-time group, use a ten-figure group, giving year, month, day, hours and minutes in UTC. This entry is the date-time at which the NOTAMN comes into force. In the cases of NOTAMR and NOTAMC, the date-time group is the actual date and time of the NOTAM origination. The start of a day shall be indicated by &#8216;0000&#8217;.</para>
            <para>6.Item C</para>
            <para>With the exception of NOTAMC, a date-time group (a ten-figure group giving year, month, day, hours and minutes in UTC) indicating duration of information shall be used unless the information is of a permanent nature in which case the abbreviation &#8216;PERM&#8217; is inserted instead. The end of a day shall be indicated by &#8216;2359&#8217;, &#8216;2400&#8217; shall not be used.

Any NOTAM which includes an &#8216;EST&#8217; shall be cancelled or replaced before the date-time specified in Item C.</para>
            <para>7.Item D</para>
            <para>If the hazard, status of operation or condition of facilities being reported on will be active in accordance with a specific time and date schedule between the dates-times indicated in Items B and C, insert such information under Item D. If Item D exceeds 200 characters, consideration shall be given to providing such information in a separate, consecutive NOTAM.</para>
            <para>8.Item E</para>
            <para>Use decoded NOTAM Code complemented, where necessary, by ICAO abbreviations, indicators, identifiers, designators, call signs, frequencies, figures and plain language. When NOTAM is selected for international distribution, English text shall be included for those parts expressed in plain language. This entry shall be clear and concise in order to provide a suitable PIB entry. In the case of NOTAMC, a subject reference and status message shall be included to enable accurate plausibility checks.</para>
            <para>9.Items F and G</para>
            <para>These items are normally applicable to navigation warnings or airspace restrictions and are usually part of the PIB entry. Insert both lower and upper height limits of activities or restrictions, clearly indicating only one reference datum and unit of measurement. The abbreviations &#8216;GND&#8217; or &#8216;SFC&#8217; shall be used in Item F to designate &#8216;ground&#8217; and &#8216;surface&#8217; respectively.

            <para>INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE COMPLETION OF THE ASHTAM FORMAT</para>
            <para>1.General</para>
            <para>1.1The ASHTAM provides information on the status of activity of a volcano when a change in its activity is, or is expected to be of operational significance. This information is provided using the volcano level of alert colour code given in 3.5 below.</para>
            <para>1.2In the event of a volcanic eruption producing ash cloud of operational significance, the ASHTAM also provides information on the location, extent and movement of the ash cloud and the air routes and flight levels affected.</para>
            <para>1.3Issuance of an ASHTAM giving information on a volcanic eruption, in accordance with section 3 below, shall not be delayed until complete information A to K is available but shall be issued immediately following receipt of notification that an eruption has occurred or is expected to occur, or a change in the status of activity of a volcano of operational significance has occurred or is expected to occur, or an ash cloud is reported. In the case of an expected eruption, and hence no ash cloud evident at that time, items A to E shall be completed and items F to I indicated as &#8216;not applicable&#8217;. Similarly, if a volcanic ash cloud is reported, e.g. by special air-report, but the source volcano is not known at that time, the ASHTAM shall be issued initially with items A to E indicated as &#8216;unknown&#8217;, and items F to K completed, as necessary, based on the special air-report, pending receipt of further information. In other circumstances, if information for a specific field A to K is not available indicate &#8216;NIL&#8217;.</para>
            <para>1.4The maximum period of validity of ASHTAM is 24 hours a day. New ASHTAM shall be issued whenever there is a change in the level of alert.</para>
            <para>2.Abbreviated heading</para>
            <para>2.1Following the usual &#8216;Aeronautical fixed &#8211; telecommunications network (AFTN)&#8217; communications header, the abbreviated heading &#8216;TT AAiiii CCCC MMYYGGgg (BBB)&#8217; shall be included to facilitate the automatic processing of ASHTAM messages in computer databanks. The explanation of these symbols is:</para>
            <para>TT =data designator for ASHTAM = VA;</para>
            <para>AA =geographical designator for States, e.g. NZ = New Zealand;</para>
            <para>iiii =ASHTAM serial number in a four-figure group;</para>
            <para>CCCC =four-letter location indicator of the flight information region concerned;</para>
            <para>MMYYGGgg =date/time of report, whereby:</para>
            <para>MM =month, e.g. January = 01, December = 12;</para>
            <para>YY =day of the month;</para>
            <para>GGgg =time in hours (GG) and minutes (gg) UTC;</para>
            <para>(BBB) =Optional group for correction to an ASHTAM message previously</para>
            <para>disseminated with the same serial number = COR.</para>
            <para>Brackets in (BBB) shall be used to indicate that this group is optional.</para>
            <para>3.Content of ASHTAM</para>
            <para>3.1Item A &#8211; Flight information region affected, plain-language equivalent of the location indicator given in the abbreviated heading, in this example: &#8216;Auckland Oceanic FIR&#8217;.</para>
            <para>3.2Item B &#8211; Date and time (UTC) of first eruption.</para>
            <para>3.3Item C &#8211; Name of volcano, and number of volcano as listed in ICAO Doc 9691 Manual on Volcanic Ash, Radioactive Material and Toxic Chemical Clouds, Appendix H, and on the World Map of Volcanoes and Principal Aeronautical Features.</para>
            <para>3.4Item D &#8211; Latitude/Longitude of the volcano in whole degrees or radial and distance of volcano from NAVAID, as listed in the ICAO Doc 9691 Manual on Volcanic Ash, Radioactive Material and Toxic Chemical Clouds, Appendix H, and on the World Map of Volcanoes and Principal Aeronautical Features.</para>
            <para>3.5Item E &#8211; Colour code for level of alert indicating volcanic activity, including any previous level of alert colour code as follows:</para>
            <para>The colour code for the level of alert indicating the status of activity of the volcano and any change from a previous status of activity shall be provided to the area control centre by the responsible vulcanological agency in the Member State concerned, e.g. &#8216;RED ALERT FOLLOWING YELLOW&#8217; OR &#8216;GREEN ALERT FOLLOWING ORANGE&#8217;.</para>
            <para>3.6Item F &#8211; If volcanic ash cloud of operational significance is reported, the horizontal extent and base/top of the ash cloud shall be indicated using latitude/longitude (in whole degrees) and altitudes in thousands of metres (feet) and/or radial and distance from source volcano. Information initially may be based only on special air-report, but subsequent information may be more detailed based on advice from the responsible meteorological watch office and/or volcanic ash advisory centre.</para>
            <para>3.7Item G &#8211; Forecast direction of movement of the ash cloud at selected levels shall be indicated based on advice from the responsible meteorological watch office and/or volcanic ash advisory centre.</para>
            <para>3.8Item H &#8211; Air routes and portions of air routes and flight levels affected, or expected to become affected, shall be indicated.</para>
            <para>3.9Item I &#8211; Closure of airspace, air routes or portions of air routes, and availability of alternative routes, shall be indicated.</para>
            <para>3.10Item J &#8211; Source of the information, e.g. &#8216;special air-report&#8217; or &#8216;vulcanological agency&#8217;, etc. The source of information shall always be indicated, whether an eruption has actually occurred or ash cloud reported, or not.</para>
            <para>3.11Item K &#8211; Any operationally significant information, additional to the foregoing, shall be included in plain language.</para>

                <para>Coded designator:BCN 1</para>
                <para>Meaning: The designator identifies a standard instrument departure route which terminates at the significant point BRECON (basic indicator). BRECON is a radio navigation facility with the identification BCN (basic indicator of the coded designator). The validity indicator ONE (1 in the coded designator) signifies either that the original version of the route is still in effect or that a change has been made from the previous version NINE (9) to the now effective version ONE (1). The absence of a route indicator signifies that only one route, in this case a departure route, has been established with reference to BRECON.</para>

                <para>GENERAL</para>
                <para>(a)The significant points should, whenever possible, be established with reference to ground-based or space-based radio navigation aids. Where such ground-based or space-based radio navigation aids do not exist, significant points should be established at a location which can be determined by self-contained airborne navigation aids, or, where navigation by visual reference to the ground is to be effected, by visual observation. Specific points may be designated as &#8216;transfer of control&#8217; points by agreement between adjacent air traffic control units or control positions concerned.</para>
                <para>(b)The designator for a significant point should be marked by the site of a radio navigation aid.</para>
                <para>(1)Plain language name for significant points marked by the site of a radio navigation aid</para>
                <para>(i)Whenever practicable, significant points should be named with reference to an identifiable and preferably prominent geographical location.</para>
                <para>(ii)In selecting a name for the significant point, care should be taken to ensure that the following conditions are met:</para>
                <para>(A)the name should not create difficulties in pronunciation for pilots or ATS personnel when speaking in the language used in ATS communications. Where the name of a geographical location in the national language selected for designating a significant point gives rise to difficulties in pronunciation, an abbreviated or contracted version of this name, which retains as much of its geographical significance as possible, should be selected (for example, FUERSTENFELDBRUCK = FURSTY);</para>
                <para>(B)the name should be easily recognisable in voice communications and should be free of ambiguity with those of other significant points in the same general area. In addition, the name should not create confusion with respect to other communications exchanged between air traffic services and pilots;</para>
                <para>(C)the name should, if possible, consist of at least six letters and form two syllables and preferably not more than three; and</para>
                <para>(D)the selected name should be the same for both the significant point and the radio navigation aid marking it.</para>
                <para>(2)Composition of coded designators for significant points marked by the site of a radio navigation aid</para>
                <para>(i)The coded designator should be the same as the radio identification of the radio navigation aid. It should be so composed, if possible, as to facilitate association with the name of the point in plain language.</para>
                <para>(ii)Coded designators should not be duplicated within 1 100 km (600 NM) of the location of the radio navigation aid concerned, except as noted hereunder.</para>
                <para>(iii)States&#8217; requirements for coded designators should be notified to the Regional Offices of ICAO for coordination.</para>
                <para>(c)The designator for a significant point not marked by the site of a radio navigation aid</para>
                <para>(1)Where a significant point is required at a position not marked by the site of a radio navigation aid, and is used for ATC purposes, it should be designated by a unique five-letter pronounceable &#8216;name-code&#8217;. This name-code designator then serves both as the name as well as the coded designator of the significant point.</para>
                <para>(2)The name-code designator should be selected so as to avoid any difficulties in pronunciation by pilots or ATS personnel when speaking in the language used in ATS communications.</para>
                <para>Examples: ADOLA, KODAP</para>
                <para>(3)The name-code designator should be easily recognisable in voice communications and should be free of ambiguity with those used for other significant points in the same general area.</para>
                <para>(4)The unique five-letter pronounceable name-code designator assigned to a significant point should not be assigned to any other significant point. When there is a need to relocate a significant point, a new name-code designator should be chosen. In cases when a State wishes to keep the allocation of specific name-codes for reuse at a different location, such name-codes should not be used until after a period of at least 6 months.</para>
                <para>(5)States&#8217; requirements for unique five-letter pronounceable name-code designators should be notified to the Regional Offices of ICAO for coordination.</para>
                <para>(6)In areas where no system of fixed routes is established or where the routes followed by aircraft vary depending on operational considerations, significant points should be determined and reported in terms of World Geodetic System &#8212; 1984 (WGS-84) geographical coordinates, except that permanently established significant points serving as exit and/or entry points into such areas should be designated.</para>
                <para>(d)The significant points are used for reporting purposes</para>
                <para>(1)In order to permit ATS to obtain information regarding the progress of aircraft in flight, selected significant points may need to be designated as reporting points.</para>
                <para>(2)In establishing such points, consideration should be given to the following factors:</para>
                <para>(i)the type of air traffic services provided;</para>
                <para>(ii)the amount of traffic normally encountered;</para>

                <para>(3)Reporting points should be established either as &#8216;compulsory&#8217; or as &#8216;on-request&#8217;.</para>
                <para>(4)In establishing &#8216;compulsory&#8217; reporting points, the following principles should apply:</para>
                <para>(i)compulsory reporting points should be limited to the minimum necessary for the routine provision of information to air traffic services units on the progress of aircraft in flight, bearing in mind the need to keep cockpit and controller workload and air-ground communications load to a minimum;</para>
                <para>(ii)the availability of a radio navigation aid at a location should not necessarily determine its designation as a compulsory reporting point; and</para>
                <para>(iii)compulsory reporting points should not necessarily be established at flight information region or control area boundaries.</para>
                <para>(5)The designation of compulsory and on-request reporting points should be reviewed regularly with a view to keeping the requirements for routine position reporting to the minimum necessary to ensure efficient air traffic services.</para>

                <para>In some instances, only a limited number of training objectives will need to be taught toATSEP learners. This is usually the case when the entry level of learners includes some form of previous qualification (e.g. engineering degree or diploma). In this case, the length of training and the number of objectives may be less than that of a course directed to learners who have little or no engineering or technical qualifications. If no engineering or technical qualifications are required prior to starting the basic training, then it may be necessary to include additional objectives in the training that will prepare learners to deal with the basic training.</para>

                <para>The technical skills assessor is the person who is considered suitable to determine whether an ATSEP is technically competent to operate, maintain, release from and return into operations systems that are necessary for the provision of services. This assessment may be in any context where assessment of technical skills is required, e.g. assessment of first competence, ongoing competence.</para>

                <para>(a)Where a technical-skill assessor works regularly with an ATSEP and he or she is required to assess the ATSEP, then continuous assessment may be appropriate, i.e. assessment may be achieved by the technical assessor observing the standard of an ATSEP&#8217;s work on a continuous basis during normal operational duties. In that case, the technical-skill assessor should inform the ATSEP of when they will be assessed.</para>
                <para>(b)If the appointed technical assessor also acts as line manager to the individual ATSEP, the service provider should have in place a process to reduce biases. Responsibility for determining competence lies with the person having the safety accountability for the ATSEP function.</para>

              <para>(d)Qualification training &#8212; Streams (Appendix 4a).</para>
              <para>The tables have the following structure:</para>
              <para>Figure 1: Structure of tables</para>
              <para>(a)Granularity table (Appendix 4a only)</para>
              <para>The granularity table indicates the stream(s) with which the objectives are associated. Where objectives are common to multiple streams, it is necessary to only include the objective once in the ATSEP training syllabus.</para>
              <para>(b)ATSEP unique objective identifier (UOID)</para>
              <para>This is a unique identifier for each objective. Where objectives are repeated across multiple streams, the UOIDis linked to the parent domain.</para>
              <para>The structure of the UOID is the following:</para>
              <para>AREA.DOMAIN.SUBJECT_topic#.subtopic#.objective#</para>
              <para>An example of a UOID decoding for ATSEP.QLF.SUR.PSR_1.2.1:</para>
              <para>ATSEP: fixed field that indicates the training area;</para>
              <para>QLF.SUR.: phase of training (qualification) and domain (surveillance);</para>
              <para>(Note: basic training uses only &#8216;BAS&#8217; without a second field);</para>
              <para>PSR: subject (primary surveillance radar);</para>
              <para>_1: topic number (PSR);</para>
              <para>.2: subtopic number (antenna (PSR)); and</para>
              <para>&#8212;.1: objective number (1).</para>
              <para>(c)Training objectives</para>
              <para>Each training objective contains three mandatory elements:</para>
              <para>Corpus</para>
              <para>A description of the required performance. It always contains an action verb at the beginning of the sentence to ensure that the outcome is observable. The action verb is always associated with a defined taxonomy.</para>
              <para>The tables at the end of this section list action verbs and their associated taxonomy levels. Those verbs and levels are used or may be used for training objectives.</para>
              <para>Taxonomy Level</para>
              <para>A numerical representation of the classification of the action verb.</para>
              <para>(i)Level 1: basic knowledge of the subject. It is the ability to remember essential points, memorise data, and retrieve it.</para>
              <para>(ii)Level 2: the ability to understand and discuss the subject matter intelligently in order to describe and act on certain objects and events.</para>
              <para>(iii)Level 3: thorough knowledge of the subject and the ability to apply it with accuracy. The ability to make use of the repertoire of knowledge to develop plans and activate them.</para>
              <para>(iv)Level 4: the ability to establish a line of action within a unit of known applications by following the correct chronology and the adequate method to resolve a problem situation. This involves integrating known applications into a familiar situation.</para>
              <para>(v)Level 5: the ability to analyse new situations in order to elaborate and apply one or another relevant strategy to solve a complex problem. The defining feature is that the situation is qualitatively different to those previously met, requiring judgement and evaluation of options.</para>
              <para>The content illustrates and details performance.</para>
              <para>When the items are in a list, each of them is to be addressed as a minimum.</para>
              <para>&#8216;e.g.&#8217; is used to indicate optional content. All content following &#8216;e.g.&#8217; is provided to illustrate the type of content that could be used to meet the objective.</para>
              <para>When there is no mandatory content, the objective has to be performed according to the action verb.</para>
              <para>Where content refers to other documents (e.g. ICAO SARPs, EU regulations, etc.), users should take care to use the most recent version(s) of the referenced document(s) or its/their parts.</para>
              <para>(d)Domain</para>
              <para>The domain is indicated through white text on blue background.</para>
              <para>The following domains are defined:</para>
              <para>QLF.SHRSHARED (common part for all qualification domains);</para>
              <para>QLF.COMCOMMUNICATION;</para>
              <para>QLF.NAVNAVIGATION;</para>
              <para>QLF.SURSURVEILLANCE;</para>
              <para>QLF.DPRDATA PROCESSING; and</para>
              <para>QLF.SMCSYSTEM MONITORING AND CONTROL.</para>
              <para>In addition, basic training is also considered to be a domain in the tables:</para>
              <para>BASBASIC.</para>
              <para>(e)Subject</para>
              <para>The subject is indicated through black text on dark grey background.</para>
              <para>A subject structures the domain into smaller elements.</para>
              <para>(f)Topic</para>
              <para>The topic is indicated through black text on mid grey background.</para>
              <para>A topic structures the subject into smaller elements.</para>
              <para>(g)Subtopic</para>
              <para>The subtopic is indicated through black text on light grey background.</para>
              <para>A subtopic structures the topic into smaller elements.</para>
              <para>(h)Action verbs</para>
              <para>The tables below list action verbs and their associated taxonomy levels that are used in training objectives.</para>
              <para>Definition of verbs &#8212; Level 1</para>
              <para>Definition of verbs &#8212; Level 2</para>
