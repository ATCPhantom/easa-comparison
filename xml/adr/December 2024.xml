        <para>EASA eRules: aviation rules for the 21st century</para>
        <para>Rules are the core of the EU civil aviation system. The aim of the EASA eRules project is to make them accessible to stakeholders in an efficient and reliable way.</para>
        <para>EASA eRules is a comprehensive, single system for structuring, sharing, and storing of rules. It is the single, easy-access online database for all aviation safety rules applicable to persons and organisations subject to Basic Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2018/1139).</para>
        <para>The Easy Access Rules (EAR) are the output of the eRules project. The EAR books are consolidated versions of those rules, combining EU regulations with the related EASA Executive Director (ED) decisions in an easy-to-read format with advanced navigation features through links and bookmarks. The EAR books are regularly updated, following the adoption of an official publication.</para>
        <para>The EAR books are available:</para>
        <para>in PDF format;</para>
        <para>as dynamic online publications (online format) with a wide range of functionalities, such as filters to obtain regulatory material tailored to one&#8217;s needs, a search function through the table of contents to quickly access the relevant sections, and easy navigation for computers, tablets, and mobiles; and</para>
        <para>in XML (machine-readable) format that can be easily processed and automated by recipients, producing output that is compatible and can be synchronised with local applications, search databases, etc.</para>
        <para>The EASA eRules system is developed and implemented in close cooperation with the Member States and aviation industry to ensure that all its capabilities are relevant and effective.</para>

        <para>THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,</para>
        <para>Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,</para>
        <para>Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 216/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 February 2008 on common rules in the field of civil aviation and establishing a European Aviation Safety Agency, and repealing Council Directive 91/670/EEC, Regulation (EC) No 1592/2002 and Directive 2004/36/EC&#160;(), amended by Regulation (EC) No 1108/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21&#160;October 2009&#160;(), and in particular Article 8a(5) thereof,</para>
        <para>Whereas:</para>
        <para>(1)Regulation (EC) No 216/2008 aims at establishing and maintaining a high uniform level of civil aviation safety in Europe.</para>
        <para>(2)The implementation of Regulation (EC) No 216/2008 requires the establishment of detailed Implementing Rules, in particular concerning the safety regulation of aerodromes, in order to maintain a high uniform level of civil aviation safety in the Union while pursuing the objective of an overall improvement in aerodrome safety.</para>
        <para>(3)It requires the Commission to adopt the necessary Implementing Rules for establishing the conditions for the design and safe operation of aerodromes referred to in Article 8a(5) before 31&#160;December 2013.</para>
        <para>(4)In order to ensure a smooth transition and a high level of civil aviation safety in the Union, the Implementing Rules should reflect the state of the art and the best practices in the field of aerodromes; take into account the applicable International Civil Aviation Organization (hereinafter referred to as &#8216;ICAO&#8217;) Standards and Recommended Practices, thereby respecting ICAO's respective classification throughout the system of rules; and worldwide aerodrome operation experience, and scientific and technical progress in the field of aerodromes; be proportionate to the size, traffic, category and complexity of the aerodrome and nature and volume of operations thereon; provide for the necessary flexibility for customised compliance; and cater for the cases of aerodrome infrastructure which has been developed, prior to the entry into force of this Regulation, in accordance with the different requirements contained in the national legislations of the Member States.</para>
        <para>(5)It is necessary to provide sufficient time for the aerodrome industry and Member States administrations to adapt to the new regulatory framework and to verify the continued validity of certificates issued before the entry into force of this Regulation.</para>
        <para>(6)With a view to ensuring uniformity in the application of common requirements, it is essential that common standards be applied by the Competent Authorities and, where applicable, the Agency when assessing compliance with these requirements; the Agency should develop Acceptable Means of Compliance and Guidance Material to facilitate the necessary regulatory uniformity. The common requirements should cater for identical processes within the competent authorities across the different aviation domains. They should not prevent, however, the application of slightly different processes if and where necessary or beneficial, for example in the case of separate overseeing entities for aerodromes and air operations. The safety objective of these requirements should remain unaffected by the different ways of technical compliance.</para>
        <para>(7)With regard to obstacle management in the aerodrome surroundings as well as to other activities taking place outside the aerodrome&#8217;s boundary each Member State may designate different authorities and other entities in charge of monitoring, assessment and mitigation risks. The aim of this Regulation is not to change current allocation of tasks within the Member State. However a seamless organisation of the competences regarding the safeguarding of aerodrome surroundings and the monitoring and mitigating of risk caused by human activities should be ensured in each Member State. It should therefore be ensured that authorities which are entrusted with responsibilities of safeguarding the surrounding of aerodromes have the adequate competencies to fulfil their obligations.</para>
        <para>(8)Specific services referred to in subpart B of Annex IV (Part ADR.OPS) should be provided at an aerodrome. In some cases these services are not directly provided by the aerodrome operator, but by another organisation or State entity, or combination of both. In such cases the aerodrome operator, being responsible for the operation of the aerodrome, should have arrangements and interfaces with these organisations or entities in place to ensure the provision of services according to the requirements stated in Annex IV. When such arrangements and interfaces are in place the aerodrome operator should be considered as having discharged their responsibility and should not be understood to be directly responsible or liable for any non-compliances by another entity involved in the arrangement, provided that it has complied with all applicable requirements and obligations laid down in this Regulation relevant to its responsibility under the arrangement.</para>

            <para>GM1 Annex I Definitions</para>
            <para>DEFINITIONS FOR TERMS USED IN THE ACCEPTABLE MEANS OF COMPLIANCE AND GUIDANCE MATERIAL</para>
            <para>For the purpose of the Acceptable Means of Compliance and Guidance Material to Regulation (EU) No&#160;139/2014, the following definitions apply:</para>
            <para>(1)&#8216;Enhanced flight vision system 200 (EFVS 200) operation&#8217; means an operation with an operational credit in which visibility conditions require an EFVS to be used down to 200 ft above the FATO or runway threshold. From that point to land, natural vision is used. The RVR is not less than 550 m.</para>
            <para>(2)&#8216;Enhanced flight vision system (EFVS) - Approach (EFVS-A)&#8217; means a system that has been demonstrated to meet the criteria to be used for approach operations from a decision altitude/height (DA/H) or a minimum descent altitude/height (MDA/H) to 100&#160;ft (30&#160;m) threshold elevation while all system components are functioning as intended, but may have failure modes that could result in the loss of EFVS capability. It should be assumed for an EFVSA that:</para>
            <para>(a)the pilot will conduct a go-around at or above 100 ft threshold elevation, in the event of an EFVS failure; and</para>
            <para>(b)descent below 100&#160;ft above the threshold elevation through to touchdown and roll-out should be conducted using natural vision, so that aby failure of the EFVS does not prevent the pilot from completing the approach and landing.</para>
            <para>(3)&#8216;Enhanced flight vision system - landing (EFVS-L)&#8217; means a system that has been demonstrated to meet the criteria to be used for approach and landing operations that rely on sufficient visibility conditions to enable unaided roll-out and to mitigate for loss of EFVS function.</para>
            <para>(4)&#8216;Obstacle clearance height (OCH)&#8217; means the lowest height above the elevation of the relevant runway threshold or the aerodrome elevation, as applicable, used in establishing compliance with appropriate obstacle clearance criteria. Obstacle clearance height is referenced to the threshold elevation or in the case of non-precision approach procedures to the aerodrome elevation or the threshold elevation if that is more than 2&#160;m (7&#160;ft) below the aerodrome elevation. An obstacle clearance height for a circling approach procedure is referenced to the aerodrome elevation.</para>
            <para>(5)&#8216;Special authorisation category I (SA CAT I) operation&#8217; means a CAT I approach operation with a decision height not lower than 45&#160;m (150&#160;ft) and an RVR not less than 400&#160;m and requires special authorisation.</para>
            <para>(6)&#8216;Special authorisation category II (SA CAT II) operation&#8217; means a CAT II approach operation to a runway that does not fulfil all CAT II infrastructure requirements, and which requires special authorisation.</para>

            <para>&#8216;Frozen sand&#8217; is a method to improve the surface friction characteristics of an ice-covered surface by sand or grit fixed to the surface through a melting/freezing process. Frozen sand can be achieved using several techniques. One example is pre-wetting the material with hot water just prior to application in order to have the hot sand melting the top layer of the ice, which then immediately refreezes to fix the material to the surface. Another technique is to pre-wet the material with a suitable chemical in order to achieve a similar effect.</para>

              <para>QUALIFICATION OF AERODROME INSPECTORS AFTER SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF TRAINING</para>
              <para>(a)Upon the successful completion of the initial training (initial theoretical training, practical training, and on-the-job training) the Competent Authority should issue a formal qualification statement for each qualified aerodrome inspector listing their privileges. Credentials should also be issued for the aerodrome inspectors, to facilitate their work.</para>
              <para>(b)The background knowledge and/or working experience of the aerodrome inspectors determines their privileges (the scope of their inspection; what they are entitled to inspect). The Competent Authority should determine what the inspector is entitled to inspect taking into account the following considerations:</para>
              <para>(1)background knowledge; and</para>
              <para>(2)working experience.</para>
              <para>(c)The inspecting authority should put in place a system that will ensure that their aerodrome inspectors meet at all times the qualification criteria with regard to the eligibility, training, and recent experience.</para>

              <para>SUFFICIENT PERSONNEL</para>
              <para>(a)This Guidance Material for the determination of the required personnel is limited to the performance of certification and oversight tasks, excluding personnel required to perform tasks subject to any national regulatory requirements.</para>
              <para>(b)The elements to be considered when determining the required personnel and planning their availability may be divided into quantitative and qualitative elements:</para>
              <para>(1)Quantitative elements:</para>
              <para>(i)the number of initial certificates to be issued;</para>
              <para>(ii)the number of aerodromes and aerodrome operators certified by the Competent Authority;</para>

              <para>(v)the number of expected changes to the aerodrome infrastructure.</para>
              <para>(2)Qualitative elements:</para>
              <para>(i)the size, nature, and complexity of the activities of aerodromes and aerodrome operators, as well as of organisations responsible for the provision of AMS:</para>
              <para>(A)privileges of the aerodrome operator or of the organisation responsible for the provision of AMS;</para>
              <para>(B)type and scope of the approval;</para>

              <para>(B)implementation of corrective actions.</para>
              <para>(iii)the size of the Member State&#8217;s aviation industry, and the potential growth of the activities in the field of civil aviation, which may be an indication of the number of new applications and changes to existing certificates to be expected.</para>
              <para>(c)Based on existing data from previous oversight planning cycles, and taking into account the situation within the Member State&#8217;s aviation industry, the Competent Authority may estimate:</para>
              <para>(1)the standard working time required for processing applications for certificates;</para>
              <para>(2)the standard working time required for processing declarations;</para>
              <para>(3)the number of new declarations, or changes to declarations;</para>
              <para>(4)the number of new certificates to be issued for each planning period; and</para>
              <para>(5)the number of changes to existing certificates to be processed for each planning period.</para>
              <para>(d)In line with the Competent Authority&#8217;s oversight policy, the following planning data is determined specifically for each aerodrome and aerodrome operator, as well as for organisations responsible for the provision of AMS:</para>
              <para>(1)standard number of audits/inspections to be performed per oversight planning cycle;</para>
              <para>(2)standard duration of each audit/inspection;</para>
              <para>(3)standard working time for audit/inspection preparation, on-site audit/inspection, reporting and follow-up, per aerodrome inspector; and</para>
              <para>(4)minimum number and required qualification of aerodrome inspectors for each audit/inspection.</para>
              <para>(e)Standard working time may be expressed either in working hours per aerodrome inspector, or in working days per aerodrome inspector. All planning calculations should, then, be based on the same unit (hours or working days).</para>
              <para>(f)It is recommended to use a spread sheet application to process data defined under (c) and (d) above, to assist in determining the total number of working hours/days per oversight planning cycle required for certification, oversight, and enforcement activities. This application could also serve as a basis for implementing a system for planning the availability of personnel.</para>
              <para>(g)For each aerodrome, aerodrome operator, and organisation responsible for the provision of AMS, the number of working hours/days per planning period for each qualified aerodrome inspector that may be allocated for certification, oversight and enforcement activities is determined, taking into account:</para>
              <para>(1)purely administrative tasks not directly related to oversight and certification;</para>
              <para>(2)training;</para>
              <para>(3)participation in other projects;</para>
              <para>(4)planned absence; and</para>
              <para>(5)the need to include a reserve for unplanned tasks or unforeseeable events.</para>
              <para>(h)The determination of the working time available for certification, oversight, and enforcement activities may also consider the possible use of qualified entities.</para>
              <para>(i)Based on the elements listed above, the Competent Authority will be able to:</para>
              <para>(1)monitor the dates when audits and inspections are due, and when they have been carried out;</para>
              <para>(2)implement a system to plan the availability of its personnel; and</para>
              <para>(3)identify possible gaps between the number and qualification of its personnel and the required volume of certification and oversight.</para>
              <para>Care should be taken to keep planning data up to date, in line with changes in the underlying planning assumptions, with particular focus on risk-based oversight principles.</para>

              <para>(a)Responsibility for the safe operation of an aerodrome lies with the aerodrome operator. Under these provisions, a positive move is made towards devolving upon the aerodrome operator a share of the responsibility for monitoring the safety of operations. The objective cannot be attained unless aerodrome operators are prepared to accept the implications of this policy, including that of committing the necessary resources to its implementation. Crucial to success of the policy is the content of Part-ADR.OR which requires the establishment of a management system by the aerodrome operator.</para>
              <para>(b)The Competent Authority should continue to assess the aerodrome operator&#8217;s or apron management service provider&#8217;s compliance with the applicable requirements, including the effectiveness of its management system. If their management system is judged to have failed in its effectiveness, then this in itself is a breach of the requirements which may, among others, call into question the validity of the certificate or declaration, if applicable.</para>
              <para>(c)The accountable manager is accountable to the Competent Authority as well as to those who may appoint him/her. It follows that the Competent Authority cannot accept a situation in which the accountable manager is denied sufficient funds, manpower, or influence to rectify deficiencies identified by the management system.</para>

              <para>(d)Aerodrome inspectors should analyse and assess the root cause(s) identified by the aerodrome operator or the organisation responsible for the provision of AMS, and be satisfied that the corrective actions taken are adequate to correct the non-compliance, and to prevent its reoccurrence.</para>
              <para>(e)Inspections and audits may be conducted jointly or separately. Inspections and audits may also be coordinated with inspections and audits conducted by the competent authorities responsible for other areas, to address areas of coordination between aerodrome operator and the providers of other services (e.g. ATM/ANS). Joint audits with competent authorities for other areas should also be performed because they are particularly effective to examine the interfaces between different actors at the aerodrome (e.g. airport and ATS), including the prevention of runway excursions and incursions.</para>
              <para>(f)Inspections may, at the discretion of the Competent Authority, be conducted with or without prior notice to the aerodrome operator or the organisation responsible for the provision of AMS.</para>
              <para>(g)Where it is apparent to an aerodrome inspector that an aerodrome operator or an organisation responsible for the provision of AMS has failed to comply with the applicable requirements, with the result that safety has been or might have been compromised, the aerodrome inspector should ensure that the person in charge within the Competent Authority is informed without delay.</para>
              <para>(h)In the first few months of a new operation, physical change of the aerodrome or organisational restructure, aerodrome inspectors should be particularly alert to any irregular procedures, evidence of inadequate facilities or equipment, or indications that management control of the operation may be ineffective.</para>
              <para>(i)Aerodrome inspectors should take account of any conditions that may indicate a significant deterioration in the financial situation of the aerodrome operator or of the organisation responsible for the provision of AMS. When any financial difficulties are identified, aerodrome inspectors should increase the technical surveillance of the operation with particular emphasis on the upholding of safety standards.</para>
              <para>(j)The number or the magnitude of the non-compliances identified by the Competent Authority will serve to support the Competent Authority&#8217;s continuing confidence in the aerodrome operator&#8217;s competence or in the competence of the organisation responsible for the provision of AMS, or, alternatively, may lead to a breach of confidence. In the latter case, the Competent Authority will need to review any identified shortcomings of the management system, and take appropriate action if required.</para>

              <para>When the Competent Authority assesses a proposal of an applicant who has requested to demonstrate an equivalent level of safety, the Competent Authority should pay, amongst others, particular attention to:</para>
              <para>(a)the identification of the intent of the Agency&#8217;s certification specifications in question, and assess if the proposal satisfies that intent;</para>
              <para>(b)any possible interconnections/relationships between the Agency&#8217;s certification specifications which the proposal is related to, with any other certification specifications or requirements, in order to:</para>

              <para>(2)establish if such interconnections/relationships and implications have been properly and adequately addressed by the applicant.</para>
              <para>The applicant&#8217;s proposal may involve design, technical, procedural, or other suitable means.</para>
              <para>The demonstration of an equivalent level of safety may involve various methodologies, quantitative or qualitative, whose magnitude and complexity may vary, depending on each case.</para>
              <para>In any case, the applicant should demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Competent Authority that the proposed solution offers a level of safety, which is effectively not lower than that associated with the relevant Agency certification specifications.</para>

              <para>(a)Changes in nominated persons: The Competent Authority should be informed of any changes to nominated persons (see ADR.OR.D.015) that may affect the certificate or the terms of approval attached to it. When an aerodrome operator submits the name of a nominee for the nominated persons, the Competent Authority should assess his/her qualifications, and may interview the nominee, or call for additional evidence of his/her suitability. (see GM1&#160;ADR.AR.C.035(a)).</para>
              <para>(b)The Competent Authority should receive from the aerodrome operator each management system documentation amendment, including amendments that do not require prior approval by the Competent Authority. A documented systematic approach should be used for maintaining the information on when an amendment was received by the Competent Authority and when it was approved.</para>
              <para>(c)Where the amendment requires the Competent Authority&#8217;s approval, the Competent Authority, when satisfied, should indicate its approval in writing. Where the amendment does not require prior approval, the Competent Authority should acknowledge receipt in writing within the time limits existing under the relevant national legislation.</para>
              <para>(d)For changes requiring prior approval, in order to verify the aerodrome operator's compliance with the applicable requirements, the Competent Authority should consider the need to conduct an audit of the operator, limited to the extent of the changes. If required for verification, the audit should include additional interviews and inspections carried out at the aerodrome operator&#8217;s facilities.</para>

              <para>The safety policy is the means whereby the aerodrome operator states its intention to maintain and, where practicable, improve safety levels in all its activities, and to minimise its contribution to the risk of an aircraft accident as far as reasonably practicable.</para>

              <para>The safety policy should actively encourage effective safety reporting and, by defining the line between acceptable performance (often unintended errors) and unacceptable performance (such as negligence, recklessness, violations, or sabotage), provide fair protection to reporters. A safety or just culture may not, however, preclude the &#8216;criminalisation of error&#8217;, which is legally, ethically, and morally within the sovereign rights of any Member State, provided European Union law and established international agreements are observed. A judicial investigation, and consequences of some form, may be expected following an accident or serious incident especially if a failure resulted in lives lost or property damaged, even if no negligence or ill intent existed. A potential issue could, therefore, exist if voluntary hazard reports, which relate to latent deficiencies of a system or its performance, are treated in the same way as those concerning accident, and serious incident investigations. The intent of protecting hazard reports should not challenge the legitimacy of a judicial investigation, or demand undue immunity. However, legal argument does usually take precedence over any technical or safety-related argument.</para>

              <para>(2)Hazard identification may use internal and external sources.</para>

              <para>(C)state voluntary reporting system.</para>
              <para>(3)The methods used for hazard identification depends on the resources and constraints of each particular aerodrome operator, and on the size and the complexity of the operations. Nevertheless, hazard identification, regardless of implementation, complexity and size, is part of the aerodrome operator&#8217;s safety documentation. Under mature safety management practices, hazard identification is a continuous, on-going daily activity. It is an integral part of the aerodrome operator&#8217;s processes. There are three specific conditions under which special attention to hazard identification should be paid. These three conditions should trigger more in depth and far reaching hazard identification activities and include:</para>
              <para>(i)any time that the aerodrome operator experiences an unexplained increase in safety related events or regulatory infractions;</para>
              <para>(ii)any time major operational changes are foreseen, including changes to key personnel or other major equipment or systems; and</para>
              <para>(iii)before and during periods of significant organisational change, including rapid growth or contraction, corporate mergers, acquisitions, or downsizing.</para>
              <para>(4)Hazard identification may use the following tools and techniques:</para>
              <para>(i)brainstorming which is an unbounded but facilitated discussion with a group of experts;</para>
              <para>(ii)Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) Study which is a systematic and structured approach using parameter and deviation guidewords. This technique relies on a very detailed system description being available for study, and usually involves breaking down the system into well-defined subsystems and functional or process flows between subsystems. Each element of the system is then subject to discussion within a multidisciplinary group of experts, against the various combinations of the guidewords and deviations;</para>
              <para>(iii)checklists, which are lists of known hazards or hazard causes that have been derived from past experience. The past experience could be previous risk assessments, or similar systems, or operations, or from actual incidents that have occurred in the past. The technique involves the systematic use of an appropriate checklist, and the consideration of each item on the checklist for possible applicability to a particular system. Checklists should always be validated for applicability prior to use;</para>
              <para>(iv)Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA), which is a &#8216;bottom up&#8217; technique, used to consider ways in which the basic components of a system can fail to perform their design intent. The technique relies on a detailed system description, and considers the ways in which each sub-component of the system could fail to meet its design intent, and what the consequences could be for the overall system. For each sub-component of a system the FMEA should consider:</para>
              <para>(A)all the potential ways that the component could fail;</para>
              <para>(B)the effects that each of these failures would have on the system behaviour;</para>
              <para>(C)the possible causes of the various failure modes; and</para>
              <para>(D)how the failures might be mitigated within the system or its environment.</para>
              <para>The system level at which the analysis is applied can vary, and is determined by the level of detail of the system description used to support the analysis. Depending on the nature and complexity of the system, the analysis could be undertaken by an individual system expert, or by a team of system experts acting in group sessions.</para>
              <para>(v)the Structured What-If Technique (SWIFT) is a simple and effective alternative technique to HAZOP and involves a multidisciplinary team of experts. It is a facilitated brainstorming group activity, but is typically carried out on a higher level system description, having fewer sub-elements, than for HAZOP and with a reduced set of prompts.</para>
              <para>(5)Identified hazards should be registered in a hazard log (hazard register). The nature and format of such a hazard log may vary from a simple list of hazards to a more sophisticated relational database linking hazards to mitigations, responsibilities, and actions. The following information should be included in the hazard log:</para>
              <para>(i)unique hazard reference number against each hazard;</para>
              <para>(ii)hazard description;</para>
              <para>(iii)indication of the potential causes of the hazard;</para>
              <para>(iv)qualitative assessment of the possible outcomes and severities of consequences arising from the hazard;</para>
              <para>(v)qualitative assessment of the risk associated with the possible consequences of the hazard;</para>
              <para>(vi)description of the existing risk controls for the hazard; description of additional actions that are required to reduce safety risks, as well as target date of completion; and</para>
              <para>(vii)indication of responsibilities in relation to the management of risk controls.</para>
              <para>(6)Additionally, the following information may also be included in the hazard log:</para>
              <para>(i)a quantitative assessment of the risk associated with the possible consequences of the hazard;</para>
              <para>(ii)record of actual incidents or events related to the hazard, or its causes;</para>

              <para>(iv)statement of formal system monitoring requirements;</para>
              <para>(v)indication of how the hazard was identified;</para>
              <para>(vi)hazard owner;</para>
              <para>(vii)assumptions; and</para>
              <para>(viii)third party stakeholders.</para>
              <para>(b)Hazard identification &#8212; Indicators</para>
              <para>(1)Reactive (lagging) indicators:</para>
              <para>Metrics that measure events that have already occurred and that impact on safety performance.</para>
              <para>As reactive indicators only reflect system failures, their use can only result in determining a reactive response. Although they do measure failure to control hazards, they do not normally reveal why the system failed, or if there are any latent hazards.</para>
              <para>(2)Proactive (leading) indicators:</para>
              <para>Metrics that measure inputs to the safety system (either within an organisation, a sector, or across the total aviation system) to manage and improve safety performance.</para>
              <para>Proactive indicators indicate good safety practices being introduced, developed, and adapted which by their inclusion seek to establish a proactive safety environment that engenders continuous improvement. They provide useful information when accident and incident rates are low to identify latent hazards and potential threats, and consequent opportunities for improvement.</para>
              <para>There should always be a connection between a proactive indicator and the unwanted outcomes (or reactive indicators) that their monitoring is intended to warn against.</para>
              <para>(3)Predictive indicators (precursor events):</para>
              <para>These metrics can be considered as indicators that do not manifest themselves in accidents or serious incidents. They indicate less severe system failures or &#8216;near misses&#8217; which when combined with other events may lead to an accident or serious incident.</para>
              <para>In a large organisation, a mature safety management system should include all of these measures. Risk management effort, however, should be targeted at leading indicators and precursor events.</para>

              <para>Safety (risk) assessment is the analysis of the safety risks of the consequences of the hazards that have been determined. Safety risk analysis breaks down the risks into two components &#8212; the probability of occurrence of a damaging event or condition, and the severity of the event or condition, should it occur. Safety risk decision making and acceptance should be specified through a risk tolerability matrix. The definition and final construction of the matrix should be left to the operator to design, be documented in the aerodrome manual, and be subject to an approval by the Competent Authority.</para>

              <para>(1)Correct and thorough training is essential to optimise compliance in every aerodrome operator. In order to achieve significant outcomes of such training, the operator should ensure that all personnel understand the objectives as laid down in the operator&#8217;s management system documentation.</para>
              <para>(2)Those responsible for managing the compliance monitoring should receive training on this task. Such training should cover the requirements of compliance monitoring, manuals and procedures related to the task, audit techniques, reporting, and recording.</para>
              <para>(3)Time should be provided to train the personnel involved in compliance management, and for briefing the remaining of the personnel.</para>

              <para>(e)Compliance monitoring &#8212; audit scheduling</para>
              <para>(1)A defined audit schedule to be completed during a specified calendar period and a periodic review cycle for each area should be established. The compliance monitoring itself should also be audited according to a defined audit schedule. The schedule should allow for unscheduled audits when trends are identified. Follow-up audits should be scheduled to verify that corrective action was carried out, and that it was effective and completed, in accordance with the policies and procedures specified in the aerodrome manual.</para>
              <para>(2)The aerodrome, its management system key processes, procedures and its operation should be audited within the first 12 months since the date of the issuance of the certificate.</para>
              <para>(3)After that, the aerodrome operator should consider the results of its safety (risk) assessments and of its past compliance monitoring activities, in order to adapt the calendar period within which an audit or a series of audits should be conducted, to cover the whole aerodrome, its management system key processes, procedures and its operation in a manner, and at intervals set out in the aerodrome manual. This calendar period, should be consistent with the relevant competent authority&#8217;s oversight planning cycle and may be increased, up to 36 months, in coordination with the competent authority, provided that there are no level 1 findings, and subject to the aerodrome operator having a good record of rectifying findings in a timely manner.</para>

              <para>GM1 ADR.OR.D.017(a);(b);(c);(d) Training and proficiency check programmes</para>
              <para>TRAINING &#8212; GENERAL</para>
              <para>(a)Aerodrome operator&#8217;s personnel</para>
              <para>(1)The purpose of the training programme is to ensure the initial and continued competence of the aerodrome operator&#8217;s personnel to perform their duties, irrespective of their level in the organisation of the aerodrome. This is to be achieved by ensuring that each person receives initial, recurrent, and if necessary, refresher training (as a result of absence from duties), and other ad hoc training (e.g. due to the planned/implemented change to the aerodrome system, etc.), which is relevant to his or her function and tasks.</para>
              <para>One method to achieve this is by identifying the tasks of the employees and ensuring that each one of them receives the training that corresponds to such tasks.</para>
              <para>For example, an employee whose tasks involve driving would need to undergo the relevant driving training (depending on the area of the aerodrome that he or she will operate in the course of his or her duties). Moreover, if the duties of that person involve also conducting inspections of the movement area, then the training plan for that employee would also need to include relevant training for that area.</para>
              <para>Moreover, apart from this specific type of training, one would also consider the need for all personnel to undergo a safety management system training relevant to their duties.</para>
              <para>(2)As part of the process of the development of the training programme, there are also other issues that need to be considered, such as:</para>
              <para>(i)the content and duration of the courses;</para>
              <para>(ii)the minimum performance required by the trainees;</para>
              <para>(iii)the method to be used for the delivery of the training;</para>
              <para>(iv)the way the competency assessments of the trainees will be performed; and</para>
              <para>(v)the development of the relevant procedures to ensure that the training programme achieves its objectives and covers circumstances that may occur (e.g. the case where an employee fails to achieve the required competency level).</para>
              <para>Consideration needs to be given to the fact that the relevant procedures would also need to address the organisation and implementation of the recurrent, refresher and continuation training.</para>
              <para>(b)Personnel of other organisations operating or providing services at the aerodrome</para>
              <para>(1)At the aerodrome environment, there may be also other organisations that operate or provide their services to other organisations or the aerodrome operator. Given that such activities may have an effect on safety and affect aerodrome operations, it is necessary to ensure that the personnel of these organisations that are allowed unescorted access to the movement area and other operational areas of the aerodrome, are trained in the applicable aerodrome&#8217;s operational procedures and requirements, so that they are enabled to safely operate within the aerodrome environment (e.g. the apron, and sometimes on the manoeuvring area), sharing a common understanding about safety management.</para>
              <para>To achieve this, the aerodrome operator needs to identify which are the applicable operational procedures and requirements for the relevant training of this type of personnel.</para>
              <para>For instance, if an employee of another organisation needs to drive and work on the apron or on the manoeuvring area, then he or she would need to undergo the relevant training prior to being allowed to do so. This would involve the relevant driving training. On the other hand, the same person would be subject to certain aerodrome operational procedures and requirements which apply on this area, and so he or she would need to also receive training on these procedures and requirements (e.g. as part of the FOD control programme). Moreover, there is also an additional need for this employee toreceive a safety management system training relevant to their duties, e.g. how to file an occurrence report, etc.</para>
              <para>(2)As part of this process, the aerodrome operator would need to make considerations similar to the ones referred to in (a)(2) above, in order to ensure the continued competence and awareness of such personnel in the required fields.</para>
              <para>(3)In this way, the aerodrome operator is expected to be able to safely manage the interfaces it has with the other organisations present at the aerodrome. However, in order to ensure the successful implementation of this training, the aerodrome operator would need to cooperate and have relevant arrangements with the organisations whose employees need to complete this training. Depending on the situation and the solutions chosen in each case, the content of the arrangements may vary and cover different areas, such as the exchange of relevant information regarding absence of personnel for the organisation of a refresher training, the use of instructors or assessors proposed by these organisations for the implementation of the relevant part of the training programme, etc.</para>
              <para>(4)It is to be noted that the training related to the performance of the actual duties of this type of personnel (e.g. how to use its own organisation&#8217;s equipment, or the internal procedures of that organisation, etc.) falls outside of the scope of this part of the training required under ADR.OR.D.017.</para>
              <para>(c)Understanding of the aerodrome system as a whole</para>
              <para>It is important that the training provides all trainees with an understanding of the interdependencies between the various functions and actors at the aerodrome environment, and how their work is related to the functions and work of other personnel and organisations, so that they acquire a rather &#8216;global&#8217; (as opposed to an &#8216;isolated&#8217;) perspective.</para>

              <para>(a)Theoretical training</para>
              <para>(1)A suitable method (or suitable methods) for the delivery of each part of the required training should be identified and specified in the training programme.</para>
              <para>(2)The theoretical training should be delivered at appropriate training facilities, and the delivery of the training should be supported by means and equipment which are suitable for the training area covered.</para>
              <para>Computer-based training may also be used, where interaction of the trainee(s) with other persons is not necessary and where the training material has been prepared, reviewed and updated by an instructor nominated in accordance with AMC1&#160;ADR.OR.D.017(h). Where provided, such training should consider human factors principles, and, as a minimum, should also cater for the possibility for the trainees to ask questions and receive clarifications, as well as to provide feedback.</para>
              <para>(3)After the initial training, the acquired competency should be assessed. The competency assessment should be accomplished by using identified method(s), appropriate to the training element to be assessed. Assessment procedures should be established, addressing, as a minimum, location(s), identity check and invigilation, and assessment discipline. Computer-based systems may be used for the assessment of the trainees provided that:</para>
              <para>(i)the assessment material is prepared, reviewed and updated by an assessor nominated in accordance with AMC1&#160;ADR.OR.D.017(h); and</para>
              <para>(ii)the assessment is conducted in a controlled facility and environment and in a manner that physically ensures the identity of the trainees during the assessment process.</para>
              <para>(4)Training elements that require individual practical participation may be combined with practical assessments.</para>
              <para>(b)Practical training</para>
              <para>(1)The practical training should follow the successful completion of the theoretical training and should be provided by an instructor nominated in accordance with AMC1&#160;ADR.OR.D.017(h). The duration of the practical training should be appropriate to the area covered.</para>
              <para>(2)A practical competency assessment should be conducted by an assessor nominated in accordance with AMC1&#160;ADR.OR.D.017(h), following the completion of each practical training provided. Assessment procedures should be established, addressing, as a minimum, location(s), identity check, and assessment discipline.</para>

              <para>(a)The methods to be used for the delivery of the theoretical training include, but are not limited to, the following:</para>
              <para>(1)lecture;</para>
              <para>(2)lesson/demonstration;</para>
              <para>(3)case study;</para>
              <para>(4)exercises, including computer-based practical exercises;</para>
              <para>(5)facilitation;</para>
              <para>(6)group work;</para>
              <para>(7)interactive training; and</para>
              <para>(8)supervised practices.</para>
              <para>(b)The methods to be used for the competency assessmentof the trainees upon completion of the theoretical trainingcould include:</para>
              <para>(1)practical demonstration;</para>
              <para>(2)computer-based assessment;</para>
              <para>(3)oral or written assessments;</para>
              <para>or combinations of such methods, as appropriate.</para>
              <para>When determining the method(s) to be used for the assessment of the trainees, the advantages and the limitations of each method, as well as the objectives of the training, would need to be taken into account.</para>
              <para>For example, the oral assessment may be used to test the understanding of the trainees around certain issues, as well as the requirements governing them, to have a clearer indication that the trainee not only knows what he or she should be doing in a given case, but also why he or she should be doing it. However, the oral assessment requires considerable skills and it should be undertaken in a way that ensures consistency among individual assessors. On the other hand, written assessments may also be used to test the theoretical knowledge and to a lesser degree the understanding of the trainees. Written tests may be easier to administer and to ensure their consistency, particularly when using multiple-choice questions. However, multiple-choice questions may test knowledge, but they may not be appropriate for determining how a person would react in an operational situation. A written assessment may also be computer-based.</para>

              <para>A method to ensure the objective evaluation of the trainee in case the instructor and the assessor isthe same person, is the use of multiple-choice questionnaires to avoid any risk of interpretation of the answers given. For an assessment, which is done directly by the instructor, e.g. a practical test, the use of a standard checklist with clear evaluation criteria can support an objective evaluation.</para>

              <para>AERODROME MANUAL</para>
              <para>(a)Form of the aerodrome manual</para>
              <para>The aerodrome manual is a key document both for the aerodrome operator and the Competent Authority. The manual is the source document describing how the aerodrome infrastructure, facilities, and operational procedures will operate safely.</para>
              <para>As well as the operational procedures, the Competent Authority will expect the aerodrome manual to be an accurate reflection of the day-to-day functioning of the aerodrome's safety management system, and its safety culture. It will need to show how the aerodrome intends to measure its performance against safety targets and objectives. The reader of an aerodrome manual should be given a clear statement of how safety is developed, managed, and maintained on the aerodrome. All safety policies, operational procedures and instructions should be contained in detail when relevant or cross-referenced to other controlled, formally accepted or recognised, publications.</para>
              <para>At larger aerodromes, the size and complexity of operations, and related procedures may dictate that these procedures could not easily be included in a single document. In such circumstances, it is acceptable to identify and reference within the aerodrome manual the procedures which are not included within it. If this system is to be successful, it is essential that any referenced information, documentation, and procedures are made available as necessary to all operational staff in a similar way as the aerodrome manual itself. For that purpose, a computerised database containing the referenced procedures and information could be suitable. For many small aerodromes, the aerodrome manual can be both simple and brief as long as it covers procedures essential for satisfactory day-to-day operations. Nevertheless, it is possible to adopt a common format embracing the essential elements that define a safety management system.</para>
              <para>(b)Purpose of the aerodrome manual</para>
              <para>An efficient management structure and a systematic approach to aerodrome operation is essential. The aerodrome manual should contain all the relevant information to describe this structure satisfactorily. It is one of the means by which all relevant operating staff can be informed as to their duties and responsibilities with regard to safety. It should describe the aerodrome infrastructure, services and facilities, all operating procedures, and any restrictions on aerodrome availability.</para>
              <para>Accountability for safety must start at the very top of any organisation. One of the key elements in establishing safe working practices is the &#8216;top down&#8217; approach where all staff should understand the safety aims of the organisation, the chain of command, and their own responsibilities and accountabilities. As safety management principles are applied, the aerodrome manual should be expanded to describe clearly how the safety of operations is to be managed. To a reader or user of the aerodrome manual, there should never be any doubt in terms of &#8216;safety accountability&#8217; for each domain or activity described. Each section should define who is accountable, who is responsible, who has the authority, who has the expertise, and who actually carries out the tasks described in any section.</para>
              <para>The principle objective of an aerodrome manual should be to show how management will accomplish its safety responsibilities. The aerodrome manual will set out the policy and expected standards of performance, and the procedures by which they will be achieved.</para>
              <para>The aerodrome operator should ensure that:</para>
              <para>(1)the responsibilities of the aerodrome operator are clearly described;</para>
              <para>(2)the tasks and activities that are to be performed by the aerodrome operator or its subcontractors are listed; and</para>
              <para>(3)the means and procedures in order to complete these tasks and activities are described or appended, together with the necessary details on their frequencies and operating modes.</para>
              <para>Where responsibilities are attributed to other stakeholders, the aerodrome manual should clearly identify them.</para>

              <para>(a)Safety policy &#8212; General</para>
              <para>The safety policy is the means whereby the organisation states its intention to maintain and, where practicable, improve the level of safety in all its activities, and to minimise the risk of an aircraft accident as far as reasonably practicable.</para>
              <para>The safety policy states that the purpose of safety reporting and internal investigations is to improve safety, and not to apportion blame to individuals.</para>
              <para>(b)Safety policy &#8212; Just culture</para>
              <para>The safety policy actively encourages effective safety reporting and, by defining the line between acceptable performance (often unintended errors) and unacceptable performance (such as negligence, recklessness, violations, or sabotage), provides fair protection to reporters. A safety or just culture may not, however, preclude the &#8216;criminalisation of error&#8217;, which is legally, ethically, and morally within the sovereign rights of any Member State, provided European Union law and established international agreements are observed. A judicial investigation, and consequences of some form, may be expected following an accident or serious incident especially if a failure resulted in lives lost or property damaged, even if no negligence or ill intent existed. A potential issue could, therefore, exist if voluntary hazard reports, which relate to latent deficiencies of a system or its performance, are treated in the same way as those concerning accident and serious incident investigations. The intent of protecting hazard reports will not be to challenge the legitimacy of a judicial investigation, or demand undue immunity. However, legal argument does usually take precedence over any technical- or safety-related argument.</para>

              <para>The safety policy is the means whereby the organisation states its intention to maintain and, where practicable, improve the level of safety in all its activities, and to minimise the risk of an aircraft accident as far as reasonably practicable. It reflects the management&#8217;s commitment to safety, demonstrates the organisation&#8217;s philosophy of safety management, and becomes the foundation on which the organisation&#8217;s management system is built.

              <para>(a)Hazard identification &#8212; General</para>
              <para>(1)Hazard identification may include the following factors and processes:</para>
              <para>(i)design factors, including equipment and task design;</para>
              <para>(ii)procedures and operating practices, including the related documentation and checklists, and their validation under actual operating conditions;</para>

              <para>(vi)work environment factors, such as ambient noise and vibration, temperature, lighting, and the availability of protective equipment and clothing;</para>

              <para>(ix)human performance, restricted to medical conditions and physical limitations.</para>
              <para>(2)For hazard identification, internal and external sources may be used.</para>
              <para>(i)Internal sources:</para>
              <para>(A)voluntary occurrence-reporting schemes;</para>
              <para>(B)safety surveys;</para>
              <para>(C)safety audits;</para>

              <para>(ii)External sources:</para>
              <para>(A)accident reports;</para>
              <para>(B)State mandatory occurrence-reporting system; and</para>
              <para>(C)State voluntary occurrence-reporting system.</para>
              <para>(3)The methods used for hazard identification depend on the resources and constraints of each particular organisation, and on the size and complexity of its operations. Nevertheless, hazard identification, regardless of implementation, complexity and size, is part of the organisation&#8217;s safety documentation. In the context of mature safety management practices, hazard identification is a continuous, daily activity. It is an integral part of the organisation&#8217;s processes. There are three specific conditions under which special attention to hazard identification should be paid. These three conditions should trigger more in-depth and far-reaching hazard identification activities, and include:</para>
              <para>(i)any time the organisation experiences an unexplained increase in safety-related events or regulatory infractions;</para>
              <para>(ii)any time major operational changes are foreseen, including changes to key personnel or other major equipment or systems; and</para>
              <para>(iii)before and during periods of significant organisational changes, including rapid growth or contraction, corporate mergers, acquisitions, or downsizing.</para>
              <para>(4)For hazard identification, the following tools and techniques may be used:</para>
              <para>(i)brainstorming, which is an unbounded but facilitated discussion with a group of experts;</para>
              <para>(ii)the hazard and operability (HAZOP) study, which is a systematic and structured approach using parameter and deviation guidewords. This technique relies on a very detailed system description being available for study, and usually involves breaking down the system into well-defined subsystems and functional or process flows between subsystems. Each element of the system is then subject to discussion within a multidisciplinary group of experts against the various combinations of the guidewords and deviations;</para>
              <para>(iii)checklists, which are lists of known hazards or hazard causes that have been derived from past experience. Past experience could be previous risk assessments, or similar systems, or operations, or from actual incidents that have occurred in the past. This technique involves the systematic use of an appropriate checklist, and the consideration of each item on the checklist for possible applicability to a particular system. Checklists are always validated for applicability prior to use;</para>
              <para>(iv)the failure modes and effects analysis (FMEA), which is a &#8216;bottom-up&#8217; technique used to consider ways in which the basic components of a system can fail to perform their design intent. This technique relies on a detailed system description, and considers the ways in which each subcomponent of the system could fail to meet its design intent, and what the consequences could be for the overall system. For each subcomponent of a system, the FMEA considers:</para>
              <para>(A)all the potential ways that the component could fail;</para>
              <para>(B)the effects that each of these failures would have on the system behaviour;</para>
              <para>(C)the possible causes of the various failure modes; and</para>
              <para>(D)how the failures might be mitigated within the system or its environment.</para>
              <para>The system level at which the analysis is applied can vary, and is determined by the level of detail of the system description used to support the analysis. Depending on the nature and complexity of the system, the analysis could be undertaken by an individual system expert, or by a team of system experts that act in group sessions.</para>
              <para>(v)the structured what-if technique (SWIFT) is a simple and effective technique, alternative to the HAZOP study, and involves a multidisciplinary team of experts. It is a facilitated brainstorming group activity, but is typically carried out on a higherlevel system description, having fewer sub-elements than the HAZOP study and with a reduced set of prompts.</para>
              <para>(5)Identified hazards are registered in a hazard log (hazard register). The nature and format of such a hazard log may vary from a simple list of hazards to a more sophisticated relational database linking hazards to mitigations, responsibilities, and actions. The following information is included in the hazard log:</para>
              <para>(i)unique hazard reference number against each hazard;</para>
              <para>(ii)hazard description;</para>
              <para>(iii)indication of the potential causes of the hazard;</para>
              <para>(iv)qualitative assessment of the possible outcomes and severities of the consequences arising from the hazard;</para>
              <para>(v)qualitative assessment of the risk associated with the possible consequences of the hazard;</para>
              <para>(vi)description of the existing risk controls for the hazard; description of additional actions that are required to reduce safety risks, as well as target date of their completion; and</para>
              <para>(vii)indication of responsibilities in relation to the management of risk controls.</para>
              <para>(6)Additionally, the following information may also be included in the hazard log:</para>
              <para>(i)a quantitative assessment of the risk associated with the possible consequences of the hazard;</para>
              <para>(ii)record of actual incidents or events related to the hazard, or its causes;</para>
              <para>(iii)risk-tolerability statement;</para>
              <para>(iv)statement of formal system-monitoring requirements;</para>
              <para>(v)indication of how the hazard was identified;</para>
              <para>(vi)hazard owner;</para>
              <para>(vii)assumptions; and</para>
              <para>(viii)third-party stakeholders.</para>
              <para>(b)Hazard identification &#8212; Indicators</para>
              <para>(1)Reactive (lagging) indicators:</para>
              <para>Metrics that measure events which have already occurred and that impact on safety performance.</para>
              <para>As reactive (lagging) indicators only reflect system failures, their use can only result in determining a reactive response. Although they do measure failure to control hazards, they do not normally reveal why the system failed, or if there are any latent hazards.</para>
              <para>(2)Proactive (leading) indicators:</para>
              <para>Metrics that measure inputs to the safety system (either within an organisation, a sector, or across the total aviation system) to manage and improve safety performance.</para>
              <para>Proactive (leading) indicators indicate good safety practices being introduced, developed and adapted, which, by their inclusion, seek to establish a proactive safety environment that engenders continuous improvement. They provide useful information when accident and incident rates are low to identify latent hazards and potential threats, and consequent opportunities for improvement.</para>
              <para>There should always be a connection between a proactive indicator and the unwanted outcomes (or reactive indicators) that their monitoring is intended to warn against.</para>
              <para>(3)Predictive indicators (precursor events):</para>
              <para>These metrics can be considered as indicators that do not manifest themselves in accidents or serious incidents. They indicate less severe system failures or &#8216;near misses&#8217; which, when combined with other events, may lead to an accident or a serious incident.</para>
              <para>In a large organisation, a mature safety management system includes all these measures. Risk-management efforts, however, are targeted at proactive (leading) indicators and predictive indicators (precursor events).</para>

              <para>(1)Defined audit schedules to be completed during a specified period as well as a periodic review cycle for each audited area should be established. The compliance monitoring itself should also be audited according to a defined audit schedule. The schedule should allow for unscheduled audits when non-compliance data shows an increasing trend. Follow-up audits should be scheduled to verify that corrective action has been carried out, and that it has been effective and completed, in accordance with the policies and procedures specified in the aerodrome manual.</para>
              <para>(2)The management system&#8217;s key processes, procedures and the operation of the organisation responsible for the provision of AMS should be audited within the first 12 months from the date on which the declaration was first registered.</para>
              <para>(3)Following that, the organisation responsible for the provision of AMS should consider the results of its safety (risk) assessments and of its past compliance-monitoring activities in order to adapt the period within which an audit or a series of audits should be conducted, to cover its management system&#8217;s key processes, procedures and operations in a manner and at intervals set out in the management system manual. This period should be consistent with the relevant Competent Authority&#8217;s oversight planning cycle and may be extended up to 36 months, in coordination with the Competent Authority, provided thatthere are no level 1 findings, and subject to the organisation responsible for the provision of AMS having a good record of addressing findings in a timely manner.</para>

              <para>MANAGEMENT SYSTEM MANUAL</para>
              <para>(a)Form of the manual</para>
              <para>The management system manual is a key document both for the organisation responsible for the provision of AMS and the Competent Authority. The manual should reflect accurately the day-to-day functioning of the organisation&#8217;s safety management system and safety culture. It will need to show how the organisation intends to measure its performance against the safety targets and objectives. The reader or the user of the manual should be given a clear statement of how safety is developed, managed and maintained in the organisation. All safety policies and instructions should be presented in detail and, when relevant, cross-referenced to other controlled, formally accepted or recognised publications.</para>
              <para>(b)Purpose of the manual</para>
              <para>The manual contains all the relevant information to describe the management system structure satisfactorily. It is one of the means by which all relevant operational staff can be informed about their duties and responsibilities with regard to safety.</para>
              <para>Accountability for safety must start at the very top of the organisation. One of the key elements in establishing safe working practices is the &#8216;top-down&#8217; approach where all staff understand the safety objectives of the organisation, the chain of command and their own responsibilities and accountabilities within the organisation. As safety management principles are applied, the manual is expanded to describe clearly how the safety of operations is to be managed. The user of the manual should never be in any doubt in terms of &#8216;safety accountability&#8217; for each domain or activity described. Each section should define who is accountable, who is responsible, who has the authority, who has the expertise, and who actually carries out the tasks described in any of the sections.</para>
              <para>The principal objective of the manual should be to show how management will fulfil its safety responsibilities. The manual will set out the policy and the expected standards of performance, and the procedures by which they will be achieved.</para>

              <para>PRE-FLIGHT ALTIMETER CHECK LOCATION</para>
              <para>(a)One or more pre-flight altimeter check locations should be established.</para>
              <para>(b)The elevation of a pre-flight altimeter check location should be given as the average elevation, rounded to the nearest metre or foot, of the area on which it is located.

              <para>(c)Pre-flight check location could be located on an apron. Locating a pre-flight altimeter check location on an apron enables an altimeter check to be made prior to obtaining taxi clearance and eliminates the need for stopping for that purpose after leaving the apron. Normally an entire apron could serve as a satisfactory altimeter check location.</para>
              <para>DECLARED DISTANCES</para>
              <para>(a)The following distances should be calculated to the nearest metre or foot for a runway and reported to the aeronautical information services and Air Traffic Services:</para>

              <para>(b)The take-off run available (TORA), take-off distance available (TODA), accelerate stop distance available (ASDA) and landing distance available (LDA) should be calculated according to the following (all declared distances are illustrated for operations from left to right):</para>
              <para>(1)Where a runway is not provided with a stopway or a clearway and the threshold is located at the extremity of the runway, the four declared distances should normally be equal to the length of the runway</para>
              <para>Figure 1</para>
              <para>(2)When a runway is provided with a clearway (CWY), then the TODA will include the length of clearway.</para>
              <para>Figure 2</para>
              <para>(3)Where a runway is provided with a stopway (SWY), then the ASDA will include the length of stopway.</para>
              <para>Figure 3</para>
              <para>(4)Where a runway has a displaced threshold, then the LDA will be reduced by the distance the threshold is displaced. A displaced threshold affects only the LDA for approaches made to that threshold; all declared distances for operations in the reciprocal direction are unaffected.</para>
              <para>Figure 4</para>
              <para>(5)Where a runway is provided with more than one of the clearway, stopway, or having a displaced threshold, then more than one of the declared distances will be modified. The modification will follow the same principle as in (1)&#8211;(4)</para>

              <para>(c)The information on declared distances should be provided according to the following table:</para>

              <para>Table 1</para>
              <para>If a runway direction cannot be used for take-off or landing, or both because it is operationally forbidden, then this should be declared and the words &#8216;not usable&#8217; or the abbreviation &#8216;NU&#8217; entered.</para>
              <para>(d)When intersection take-offs are performed, the datum line from which the reduced runway declared distances for take-off are determined, should be defined by the intersection of the downwind edge as shown in the figure below:</para>

              <para>(a)Thresholds</para>
              <para>(1)For surveying purposes, threshold positions must be taken as being at the geometric centre of the runway and at the beginning of the paved surface, i.e. the beginning of that portion of the runway usable for landing. Where thresholds are marked by appropriate threshold markings (e.g. displaced thresholds), these must be taken as the threshold points. Where threshold lighting is surveyed, the locations must be described on the diagram accompanying the report. Where there is no threshold lighting, an appropriate point for survey in accordance with the following figures must be selected.</para>
              <para>Figure 1</para>
              <para>Figure 2</para>
              <para>Figure 3</para>
              <para>(2)If the runway has only one threshold certified for landing, the runway end position must be surveyed. For surveying purposes, the runway end position (flight path alignment point) must be taken as being at the geometric centre of the runway and at the end of the paved surface, i.e. the end of that portion of the runway usable for landing.</para>
              <para>(b)Taxiways and stand/checkpoints &#8212; General</para>
              <para>(1)Except as provided in (c) (1) below, for surveying purposes the centre (mid-width) of the taxiway centre line marking, apron taxilane marking or the aircraft stand guide line marking must be taken as the reference data.</para>
              <para>(2)The points of commencement and ends of straight sections of taxiways, apron taxilanes and aircraft stand point guidance lines markings must be surveyed. Sufficient additional points must be surveyed to maintain the required accuracy along the lines.</para>
              <para>(3)For curved sections of taxiways, apron taxilanes and aircraft stand guide line markings, the commencement and end of the curved section centre line must be surveyed together with the position of the centre point of the arc and its radius. In the case of a compound curve, the centre and radius of each arc and the commencement and end of each of the arcs must be surveyed. Where this is impracticable in the field, a series of sequential points must be surveyed along the curved section of the centre line with a maximum arc to chord distance not exceeding 0.25&#160;m for taxiways and 0.10&#160;m for apron taxilanes and aircraft stand guide line markings. Sufficient points must be surveyed to maintain the required accuracy along the lines.

              <para>(iii)the radius of the arc.</para>
              <para>Where this is impracticable in the field, a series of sequential points must be surveyed along the curved section of the centre line of taxiways.</para>
              <para>(2)Where taxiway centre line marking is provided on a runway that is part of a standard taxi route, or a taxiway centre line is not coincident with runway centre line, the following points must be surveyed:</para>
              <para>(i)the point on the taxiway marking at which the taxiway enters the runway;</para>
              <para>(ii)the points at which the taxiway deviates from a straight line;</para>

              <para>A continuous friction measuring device (e.g. Skiddometer, Surface Friction Tester, Mu-meter, Runway Friction Tester or GripTester), can be used for measuring the friction values for compacted snow- and ice-covered runways. A decelerometer (e.g. Tapley Meter or Brakemeter &#8212; Dynometer) may be used on certain surface conditions, e.g. compacted snow, ice and very thin layers of dry snow. Other friction measuring devices can be used, provided they have been correlated with, at least, one of the types mentioned above. A decelerometer should not be used in loose snow or slush, as it can give misleading friction values. Other friction measuring devices can also give misleading friction values under certain combinations of contaminants and air/pavement temperature.</para>

              <para>(a)Stating that resolution needs to be commensurate with the actual accuracy means that digital data needs to have sufficient resolution to maintain accuracy. Typically, if an accuracy of 0.1 unit is needed, then a resolution of 0.01 or 0.001 units would enable a data chain to preserve the accuracy without any issue. A finer resolution could be misleading as one could assume that it supports a finer accuracy. This factor range of 10 to 100 between accuracy and resolution is applicable regardless of the units of measurements used.</para>

              <para>MEAN SEA LEVEL</para>
              <para>(a)The geoid globally most closely approximates mean sea level (MSL). It is defined as the equipotential surface in the gravity field of the Earth, which coincides with the undisturbed MSL extended continuously through the continents.</para>
              <para>(b)Gravity-related heights (elevations) are also referred to as &#8216;orthometric heights&#8217;, while distances of points above the ellipsoid are referred to as &#8216;ellipsoidal heights&#8217;.</para>
              <para>(c)Global and local geoids differ in their origin: global geoids consider only the long- and middlewave part of the Earth&#8217;s gravity field, whilst local geoids also consider the short-wave part of the gravity field. Global geoids are used when consistent orthometric heights, over long distances (continent or earth surveying), are required. Currently, the world&#8217;s best global geoid model is EGM 200846. It was determined using satellite tracking, gravity anomalies and satellite altimetry. Its accuracy is in the range of &#177; 0.05 m (oceans) and &#177; 0.5 m (on land). This accuracy is higher in flat regions than in topographically mountainous terrain, such as the Alps.</para>
              <para>(d)For local engineering applications and cadastre-surveying, global geoids are not as accurate as needed. For such applications, local geoid models are calculated. These can only be developed using local field measurements. They offer centimetre accuracy over several hundred kilometres, with a high resolution. Local geoids are not suitable for height comparison over large distances since they are based on different origins and reference heights (different equipotential levels).</para>

              <para>VALIDATION AND VERIFICATION &#8212; GENERAL</para>
              <para>(a)Validation</para>
              <para>(1)Validation is the activity where a data element is checked as having a value that is fully applicable to the identity ascribed to the data element, or where a set of data elements are checked as being acceptable for their intended use.</para>
              <para>(2)The application of validation techniques considers the entire aeronautical data chain. This includes the validation performed by prior data chain participants and any requirements levied on the data supplier.</para>
              <para>(3)Examples of validation techniques include:</para>
              <para>(i)Validation by application</para>
              <para>One method of validation is to apply data under test conditions. In certain cases, this may not be practical. Validation by application is considered to be the most effective form of validation. For example, flight inspection of final approach segment data prior to publication can be used to ensure that the published data is acceptable.</para>
              <para>(ii)Logical consistency</para>
              <para>Logical consistency validates by comparing two different data sets or elements and identifying inconsistencies between values based on operative rules (e.g. business rules).</para>
              <para>(iii)Semantic consistency</para>
              <para>Semantic consistency validates by comparing data to an expected value or range of values for the data characteristics.</para>
              <para>(iv)Validation by sampling</para>
              <para>Validation by sampling evaluates a representative sample of data and applies statistical analysis to determine the confidence in the data quality.</para>
              <para>(b)Verification</para>
              <para>(1)Verification is a process for checking the integrity of a data element whereby the data element is compared to another source, either from a different process or from a different point in the same process. While verification cannot ensure that the data is correct, it can be effective to ensure that the data has not been corrupted by the data process.</para>
              <para>(2)The application of verification techniques considers only the portion of the aeronautical data chain controlled by the organisation. Yet, verification techniques may be applied at multiple phases of the data processing chain.</para>
              <para>(3)Examples of verification techniques include:</para>
              <para>(i)Feedback</para>
              <para>Feedback testing is the comparison between the output and input state of a data set.</para>
              <para>(ii)Independent redundancy</para>
              <para>Independent redundancy testing involves processing the same data through two or more independent processes and comparing the data output of each process.</para>
              <para>(iii)Update comparison</para>
              <para>Updated data can be compared to its previous version. This comparison can identify all data elements that have changed. The list of changed elements can then be compared to a similar list generated by the supplier. A problem can be detected if an element is identified as changed on one list and not on the other.</para>

              <para>NON-ORIGINATION OF NOTAM</para>
              <para>Promulgation of information through NOTAM is required under certain circumstances. In such cases, the responsible organisation (e.g. Competent Authority, aerodrome operator, air traffic services provider, etc.) originates a NOTAM, which is finally issued by the AIS provider. ADR.OPS.A.057 defines the responsibilities of the aerodrome operator with respect to the NOTAM origination process, while its point (b) requires the origination of a NOTAM by the aerodrome operator in the cases prescribed in it.</para>
              <para>On the other hand, for a variety of reasons (e.g. prevention of information overflow), not all kinds of information are eligible for promulgation through NOTAM. To this end, Regulation (EU) 2017/373, which applies to AIS providers, prescribesin AIS.TR.330 the cases where the AIS provider shall (or shall not) issue a NOTAM.</para>
              <para>This means that there are cases in which, even if an aerodrome operator originates a NOTAM to promulgate information, the NOTAM will not be finally issued by the AIS provider if this information is not allowed to be promulgated by NOTAM as per AIS.TR.330. To avoid such situations, the aerodrome operator needs to:</para>
              <para>(a)ensure that the relevant aerodrome operator&#8217;s personnel are adequately trained in the relevant regulatory framework regarding both the origination and issuance of NOTAM;</para>
              <para>(b)develop robust procedures regarding NOTAM origination by its personnel; and</para>
              <para>(c)maintain close cooperation with the relevant AIS provider.</para>
              <para>The following are example cases where the aerodrome operator will not originate a NOTAM:</para>
              <para>(a)routine maintenance work on aprons and taxiways that does not affect the safe movement of aircraft;</para>
              <para>(b)temporary obstructions in the vicinity of aerodromes/heliports that do not affect the safe operation of aircraft;</para>
              <para>(c)partial failure of aerodrome/heliport lighting facilities where such a failure does not directly affect aircraft operations;</para>
              <para>(d)partial temporary failure of air-ground communications when suitable alternative frequencies are available and are operative;</para>
              <para>(e)lack of apron marshalling services, road traffic closures, limitations and control;</para>
              <para>(f)unserviceability of location, destination or other instruction signs on the aerodrome movement area;</para>
              <para>(g)training activities performed by ground units;</para>
              <para>(h)unavailability of backup and secondary systems if these systems do not have an operational impact;</para>
              <para>(i)limitations to aerodrome facilities or general services with no operational impact;</para>
              <para>(j)announcements or warnings about possible/potential limitations with no operational impact;</para>
              <para>(k)general reminders on already published information;</para>
              <para>(l)availability of equipment for ground units, without information on the operational impact on airspace and facility users;</para>
              <para>(m)information about laser emissions with no operational impact and about fireworks below the minimum flying heights;</para>
              <para>(n)closure of parts of the movement area in connection with locally coordinated, planned work of duration of less than 1 hour;</para>
              <para>(o)closure, changes, unavailability in the operation of aerodrome(s)/heliport(s) other than in the aerodrome(s)/heliport(s) operation hours; and</para>
              <para>(p)other non-operational information of a similar temporary nature.</para>
              <para>Information which relates to an aerodrome and its vicinity and which does not affect its operational status may be distributed locally during pre-flight or in-flight briefing or other local contact with flight crews. Thus, in case of need, the aerodrome operator may disseminate such type of information through the AIS provider it has arrangements with.</para>

              <para>GENERAL</para>
              <para>(a)Assessing and reporting the condition of the movement area and related facilities is necessary in order to provide the flight crew with the information needed for safe operation of the aeroplane. The RCR is used for reporting assessed conditions through the issuance of SNOWTAM, when necessary.</para>
              <para>(b)Generally, movement areas are exposed to a multitude of climatic conditions and consequently there is a significant difference in the conditions to be reported. The RCR describes a basic structure applicable for all these climatic variations. Assessing the runway surface condition relies on a great variety of techniques and no single solution can apply to every situation.</para>
              <para>(c)The philosophy of the RCR is that the aerodrome operator assesses the runway surface condition whenever water, snow, slush, ice or frost are present on an operational runway. From this assessment, a RWYCC and a description of the runway surface are reported, which can be used by the flight crew for aeroplane performance calculations. This format, based on the type, depth and coverage of contaminants, is the best assessment of the runway surface condition by the aerodrome operator; however, all other pertinent information is taken into consideration and kept up to date, and changes in conditions are reported without delay.</para>
              <para>(d)The RWYCC reflects the runway braking capability as a function of the surface conditions. With this information, the flight crew can derive, from the performance information provided by the aeroplane manufacturer, the necessary stopping distance of an aircraft on the approach under the prevailing conditions.</para>

              <para>EXAMPLE OF REPORTING DEPTH OF CONTAMINANT WHENEVER THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE</para>
              <para>(a)After the first assessment of runway condition, a first RCR is generated. The initial report is:</para>
              <para>5/5/5 100/100/100 03/03/03 SLUSH/SLUSH/SLUSH</para>
              <para>Note: The full information string is not used in this example.</para>
              <para>(b)With continuing precipitation, a new RCR is required to be generated as a subsequent assessment reveals that the depth of contamination has increased from 3 mm to 5 mm along the entire length of the runway and therefore a change in the RWYCC is needed. A second RCR is therefore created as:</para>
              <para>2/2/2 100/100/100 05/05/05 SLUSH/SLUSH/SLUSH</para>
              <para>(c)With even more precipitation, a further assessment reveals that the depth of contamination has increased from 5 mm to 7 mm along the entire length of the runway. However, a new RCR is not required because the RWYCC has not changed (change in depth is less than the significant change threshold of 3 mm).</para>
              <para>(d)A final assessment of the contamination reveals that the depth has increased to 10 mm. A new RWYCC is required because the change in depth from the last RCR (second RWYCC), i.e. from 5 mm to 10 mm is greater than the significant change threshold of 3 mm. A third RCR is thus created as below:</para>
              <para>2/2/2 100/100/100 10/10/10 SLUSH/SLUSH/SLUSH</para>
              <para>For contaminants other than STANDING WATER, SLUSH, WET SNOW or DRY SNOW, the depth is not reported. The position of this type of information in the information string is then identified by /NR/.</para>
              <para>When the depth of the contaminants varies significantly within a runway third, additional information is to be given in the plain-language remark part of the situational awareness section of the RCR.</para>

Nevertheless, continuous friction measuring devices may be used, together with all other available means, to support upgrade or downgrade of the RWYCC, by using friction measurements in a comparative way and not as absolute values.</para>

              <para>The services included in Part B of this Annex, need to be provided at an aerodrome. In some cases, these services are not directly provided by the aerodrome operator, but by another organisation or State entity or combination of both. However, the aerodrome operator, being responsible for the operation of the aerodrome should have arrangements and interfaces with these organisations or entities to ensure that these services are provided according to the legal requirements. The method described above meets with the intention of an integrated Safety Management System that helps the aerodrome operator to ensure the safety objective of the service provision is being met. In completing this action, the aerodrome operator should hereby been seen to discharge its responsibility by employing the procedures mentioned above, furthermore, the aerodrome operator should not be understood to be directly responsible or liable for non-compliances by another entity involved in the arrangement.</para>

              <para>(a)The aerodrome operator procedures for the handover of operational activities should as a minimum:</para>
              <para>(1)cover the change of a shift within the same function (e.g. between RFFS personnel), as well as the case where a task is handed over to another person within the same shift, and the cases where an activity is handed over between different functions (e.g. from maintenance to operations);</para>

              <para>(3)allow for the preparation of both outgoing and incoming personnel.</para>
              <para>(b)The briefing should be in a manner that allows effective two-way communication between the outgoing and incoming personnel, during which all task-relevant information necessary for the incoming personnel is provided to them, both verbally and in writing. In the case of posts which are not continually manned, or aerodromes with interrupted working hours, the briefing may be in writing, while ensuring that additional information may be provided to the incoming personnel in case of such need.</para>
              <para>(c)The briefing of drivers and other operational personnel operating on the manoeuvring area should, as a minimum, include:</para>

              <para>PROVISION OF OPERATIONAL INFORMATION TO OTHER ORGANISATIONS</para>
              <para>Given that changes of the operating conditions at an aerodrome may affect all personnel operating on the movement area, there is a need to ensure that the personnel of other organisations which operate or provide services at the aerodrome are also provided with the necessary operational information, which pertains to their operating environment.</para>
              <para>Therefore, the aerodrome operator needs to provide this type of information to such organisations, so that they are enabled to relay it to their own personnel. It is important that there is no delay in the provision of such information by the aerodrome operator, and that it is done in a manner prearranged with the other organisations, to ensure it reaches its destination.</para>
              <para>Such information may include changes in the operating conditions on the apron (e.g. due to works or occurrences) or on the manoeuvring area, or other facilities of the aerodrome. For the type of information that may be provided regarding the manoeuvring area, see point (c) of AMC1&#160;ADR.OPS.B.003(a).</para>

              <para>(c)A person should be assigned to assume control of the emergency operations centre and, when appropriate, another person the command post.</para>
              <para>(d)The role of the emergency operations centre should be to support the on-the-scene commander in the mobile command post for aircraft accidents/incidents.</para>
              <para>(e)The emergency operations centre, depending on relevant security plans and local procedures could be the command, coordination, and communication centre for unlawful seizure of aircraft and bomb threats.</para>

              <para>(5)The emergency exercises should be held in locations which will provide maximum realism while ensuring minimum disruption of the aerodrome operations. Different scenarios, as described in the aerodrome emergency plan document, should be used. The exercise could be held either during the day or at night on the aerodrome, and at different times of the year when seasonal changes may present additional challenges. Exercises may take place both on or near the aerodrome to test different scenarios.</para>
              <para>(6)In order to obtain the maximum benefit from a full-scale emergency exercise, the entire proceedings should be reviewed. An observer critique team should be organised, comprised of members who are familiar with mass casualty accident proceedings. Each member of the critique team should observe the entire exercise, and complete the appropriate emergency drill critique forms. As soon as convenient after the exercise, a critique meeting should be held so members of the team can present their observations and recommendations for improvement of the aerodrome emergency plan procedures and associated aerodrome emergency plan document.</para>
              <para>(7)The exercise should be followed by a full debriefing, critique, and analysis. It is important that representatives of all organisations which participate in the exercise actively participate in the critique.</para>
              <para>(b)Partial emergency exercises</para>
              <para>(1)The purpose of a partial exercise is to ensure the adequacy of the response to individual participating agencies and components of the plan.</para>
              <para>(2)Partial emergency exercises should involve, at least, one unit, such as rescue and firefighting services, or medical, or combination of several units, as appropriate.</para>
              <para>(3)Partial emergency exercises should ensure that any deficiencies found during the full-scale aerodrome emergency exercise have been corrected.</para>
              <para>(c)Tabletop exercises</para>
              <para>Tabletop exercises should be held at regular intervals. The aim of these exercises should be to verify that roles and procedures are clear and understood. These exercises offer a good opportunity to test new or revised procedures, before implementation, or preparation for a full-scale emergency exercise.</para>

              <para>Public or private organisations, suitably located and equipped, could be designated to provide the rescue and firefighting service. The fire station housing these organisations should normally be located on the aerodrome, although an off-aerodrome location is not precluded, provided that the response time can be met. The principal objective of rescue and firefighting services is to save lives in the event of an aircraft accident or incident occurring at, or in the immediate surroundings of, the aerodrome. The rescue and firefighting service is provided to create and maintain survivable conditions, to provide egress routes for occupants,and to initiate the rescue of those occupants unable to make their escape without direct aid. The rescue may require the use of equipment and personnel other than those assessed primarily for rescue and firefighting purposes. Ambulance and medical services are out of the scope of rescue and firefighting services as described in ADR.OPS.B.010. The role and responsibilities of ambulance and medical services during an emergency situation should be included in the aerodrome emergency plan (AEP), according to GM3 ADR.OPS.B.005(a).</para>

              <para>(1)the level of protection normally available at an aerodrome is determined and expressed in terms of the category of the rescue and firefighting services (RFF aerodrome category) as described below and in accordance with the types, amounts, and discharge rates of extinguishing agents normally available at the aerodrome; and</para>
              <para>(2)the aerodrome category for rescue and firefighting is determined according to Table 1, based on the longest aeroplanes normally using the aerodrome and their fuselage width. If, after selecting the category appropriate to the longest aeroplane&#8217;s overall length, that aeroplane&#8217;s fuselage width is greater than the maximum width in Table 1, column&#160;3, for that category, then the category for that aeroplane should actually be one category higher.</para>
              <para>Table 1</para>
              <para>(3)the rescue and firefighting level of protection provided is appropriate to the aerodrome category determined using the principles in (2) above except that where the number of movements (landing or take-off) of the aeroplanes performing passenger transportation in the highest category, normally using the aerodrome, is less than 700 in the busiest consecutive three months, the level of protection provided in accordance with (2) above may be reduced by no more than one category below the determined one.</para>
              <para>(b)Notwithstanding (a), the aerodrome operator may, during anticipated periods of reduced activity (e.g. specific periods of the year or day), reduce the rescue and firefighting level of protection available at the aerodrome. In this case:</para>
              <para>(1)the level of protection should be no less than that needed for the highest category of aeroplane planned to use the aerodrome during that time, irrespective of the number of movements; and</para>
              <para>(2)the periods of aerodrome operation with reduced rescue and firefighting level of protection should be published in the aeronautical information publication (AIP) or through notice to airmen (NOTAM).</para>
              <para>(c)The level of protection required for all-cargo, mail, ferry, training, test, positioning and end-of-life aeroplane operations, including those carrying dangerous goods, irrespective of thenumber of movements, may be reduced in accordance with Table 2 as follows:</para>
              <para>Table 2</para>
              <para>(d)The aerodrome operator, in order to assess whether the rescue and firefighting level of protection to be provided at the aerodrome is appropriate to the aerodrome rescue and firefighting category, should, at least annually, forecast the aeroplane traffic expected to operate at the aerodrome for the next twelve-month period. Upon knowledge of planned changes to traffic volume and structure, additional assessments might be necessary. In doing so, the aerodrome operator may use all information available from aeroplane operators as well as statistics on aeroplane movements during the year preceding the day of review.</para>
              <para>(e)Unforeseen circumstances leading to temporary reduction of the aerodrome rescue and firefighting level of protection are considered as unplanned events that result in unavailability of facilities, equipment and resources.</para>
              <para>(f)For emergency landings and occasions when in the pilot&#8217;s-in-command opinion, a diversion or hold may create a more significant hazard, operation of aeroplanes whose required category is higher than the level of protection provided by the aerodrome should be permitted regardless of the rescue and firefighting level of protection available.</para>

This may involve, for example, a maintenance plan to ensure the mechanical efficiency of equipment and vehicles for rescue and firefighting, and arrangements to cover unplanned absence of the minimum level of personnel including supervisory levels.</para>

              <para>The following examples are intended to illustrate the way in which the various factors to be taken into account when calculating levels of protection should be applied:</para>
              <para>Example&#160;1 &#8212; Wider aeroplane fuselage</para>
              <para>If an aeroplane has a fuselage length of 47.5&#160;m, column&#160;2 of Table&#160;1 in AMC2&#160;ADR.OPS.B.010(a)(2) indicates RFF category&#160;7. However, the example aeroplane has a fuselage width of 5.5&#160;m, therefore, according to (a)(2) in AMC2&#160;ADR.OPS.B.010(a)(2), the appropriate level of protection is RFF category&#160;8.</para>
              <para>Example&#160;2 &#8212; Longer than average aeroplane length</para>
              <para>Where operations by aeroplanes larger than the average size in a given category are planned, the quantities of water should be recalculated, and the amount of water for foam production as well as the discharge rates for foam solution should be increased accordingly. The example below is based on an aeroplane with an overall length of 48&#160;m and a maximum fuselage width of 5&#160;m. The quantity of water and the discharge rate of foam solution have been calculated using the ICAO critical-area concept, and increased to reflect the greater practical critical area.</para>
              <para>Example&#160;3 &#8212; Less than 700 movements in the busiest consecutive 3&#160;months</para>
              <para>The following examples illustrate the method for the determination of the aerodrome&#8217;s rescue and firefighting level of protection when considering the number of movements:</para>
              <para>The longest aeroplanes are categorised by evaluating, based on Table&#160;1 of AMC2&#160;ADR.OPS.B.010(a)(2), firstly their overall length and secondly their fuselage width until 700 movements are reached. It may be seen that the number of movements of the longest aeroplanes in the highest category totals more than 700. The aerodrome, in this case, is category&#160;6.</para>
              <para>The longest aeroplanes are categorised by evaluating, based on Table&#160;1 of AMC2&#160;ADR.OPS.B.010(a)(2), firstly their overall length and secondly their fuselage width until 700 movements are reached. It may be seen that the number of movements of the longest aeroplanes in the highest category totals more than 700. It may also be noted that when evaluating the category appropriate to the overall length of Airbus A380, e.g. category&#160;9, the category selected is actually one level higher as the aeroplane&#8217;s fuselage width is greater than the maximum fuselage width for category&#160;9. The aerodrome, in this case, is category&#160;10.</para>
              <para>The longest aeroplanes are categorised by evaluating, based on Table&#160;1 of AMC2&#160;ADR.OPS.B.010(a)(2), firstly their overall length and secondly their fuselage width until 700 movements are reached. It may be seen that the number of movements of the longest aeroplanes in the highest category totals only 300. The minimum category for the aerodrome, in this case, is be category&#160;6, which is one category level below that of the longest aeroplane.</para>
              <para>The longest aeroplanes are categorised by evaluating, based on Table&#160;1 of AMC2&#160;ADR.OPS.B.010(a)(2), firstly their overall length and secondly their fuselage width until 700 movements are reached. It may be seen that the number of movements of the longest aeroplanes in the highest category totals only 500. It may also be noted that when evaluating the category appropriate to the overall length of Airbus A380, e.g. category&#160;9, the category selected is actually one level higher as the aeroplane&#8217;s fuselage width is greater than the maximum fuselage width for category&#160;9. The minimum category for the aerodrome, in this case, is category&#160;9, which is one category level below that of the longest aeroplane.</para>
              <para>The longest aeroplanes are categorised by evaluating, based on Table&#160;1 of AMC2&#160;ADR.OPS.B.010(a)(2), firstly their overall length and secondly their fuselage width until 700 movements are reached. It may be seen that the number of movements of the longest aeroplanes in the highest category totals only 400. The minimum category for the aerodrome is category&#160;6. However, even if there is a relatively wide range of difference between the length of the longest aeroplane (Airbus A321) and the aeroplane for which the 700th movement is reached (ATR 42), the minimum category for the aerodrome may only be downgraded to category&#160;6.</para>
              <para>Example&#160;4 &#8212; Anticipated periods of reduced activity</para>
              <para>The level of protection should be no less than that needed for the highest category of aeroplanes planned to use the aerodrome during that period. If the aerodrome has promulgated RFFS category&#160;7, but between 23:00 and 6:00, the largest aeroplane operating has an overall length of 27.5&#160;m and a maximum fuselage width of 3.9&#160;m, the promulgated category may be downgraded to category&#160;5 for that time frame.</para>

As the aeroplane is an all-cargo one, according to Table&#160;2, a reclassification to category&#160;6 may be applied.</para>

              <para>CRITICAL AREA FOR CALCULATING QUANTITIES OF WATER</para>
              <para>(a)The ICAO critical-area concept is applied for rescuing the occupants of an aeroplane. It seeks to control only that area of fire adjacent to the fuselage. The objective is to safeguard the integrity of the fuselage and maintain tolerable conditions for the occupants of the aeroplane. The size of the controlled area required to achieve this for a specific aeroplane has been determined by experimental means.</para>
              <para>(b)There is a need to distinguish between the theoretical critical area, within which it may be necessary to control the fire, and the practical critical area, which is representative of actual aeroplane accident conditions. The theoretical critical area serves only as a means of categorising aeroplanes in terms of the magnitude of the potential fire hazard in which they may become involved. It is not intended to represent the average maximum or minimum spill fire size associated with a particular aeroplane. The theoretical critical area is a rectangle having as one dimension the overall length of the aeroplane and as the other dimension a length which varies with the fuselage&#8217;s length and width.</para>
              <para>(c)From experiments performed, it has been established that for an aeroplane with a fuselage length equal to or greater than 24&#160;m, in wind conditions of 16&#8211;19&#160;km/h and at right angles to the fuselage, the theoretical critical area extends from the fuselage to a distance of 24&#160;m upwind and 6&#160;m downwind. For smaller aeroplanes, a distance of 6&#160;m on either side is adequate. To provide for a progressive increase in the theoretical critical area however, a transition is used when the fuselage length is between 12 and 24&#160;m.</para>
              <para>(d)The overall length of the aeroplane is considered appropriate for the theoretical critical area as the entire length of the aeroplane must be protected from burning. If not, the fire might burn through the skin and enter the fuselage. Moreover, other aeroplanes, such as T-tail ones, often have engines or exit points in their extended portion.</para>
              <para>(e)The formula for the theoretical critical area AT should be the following:</para>
              <para>where &#8216;L&#8217; is the overall length of the aeroplane, and &#8216;W&#8217; is the maximum width of the aeroplane fuselage.</para>
              <para>(f)In practice, it is seldom that the entire theoretical critical area is subject to fire; thus, a smaller area for which it is proposed to have firefighting capacity is referred to as the practical critical area. As a result of a statistical analysis of actual aeroplane accidents, the practical critical area AP has been found to be approximately two thirds of the theoretical critical area AT, or</para>
              <para>Ap=0.667 &#215;AT</para>
              <para>(g)The quantity of water for foam production should be calculated with the following formula:</para>
              <para>Q=Q1+Q2</para>
              <para>where:</para>
              <para>&#8216;Q&#8217; is the total water required;</para>
              <para>&#8216;Q1&#8217; is the water used to control the fire in the practical critical area; and</para>
              <para>&#8216;Q2&#8217; is the water required after control of the fire has been established, and is needed for maintaining this control and/or extinguishing the remaining fire.</para>
              <para>(h)The water required for control of the fire in the practical critical area (Q1) may be expressed by the following formula:</para>
              <para>Q1=Ap&#215;R&#215;T</para>
              <para>where:</para>
              <para>&#8216;Ap&#8217; is the practical critical area;</para>
              <para>&#8216;R&#8217; is the rate of application; and</para>
              <para>&#8216;T&#8217; is the time of application.</para>
              <para>(i)The amount of water required for Q2 may not be exactly calculated as it depends on a number of variables. The factors considered to be of primary importance are:</para>
              <para>(1)the maximum gross mass of the aeroplane;</para>
              <para>(2)the maximum passenger capacity of the aeroplane;</para>
              <para>(3)the maximum fuel load of the aeroplane; and</para>

              <para>GM1 ADR.OPS.B.010(a)(4) Rescue and firefighting services</para>
              <para>MEDICAL ASSESSMENT</para>
              <para>1.General</para>
              <para>Rescue and firefighting personnel, when responding to an accident, need to be capable of withstanding physically aggressive conditions whilst performing efficiently. Additionally, managing life-threatening situations which put at risk aircraft occupants&#8217; safety requires also mental fitness. For this reason, decision-making and stress management should not be impaired.</para>
              <para>The key fitness components for rescue and firefighting personnel are aerobic fitness, anaerobic fitness, flexibility and medical fitness. Optimum physical and medical fitness would mean that a firefighter is able to carry out rescue and firefighting activities safely, successfully and without unjustified fatigue.</para>
              <para>In order to understand better the key fitness components, the following aspects may have to be considered:</para>
              <para>Aerobic fitness refers to the ability to continue to exercise for prolonged periods of time at low to moderate or high intensity. This depends upon the capacity of the body&#8217;s heart, lungs and blood to get the oxygen to the muscles (VO2) providing the sustained energy to maintain prolonged exercise.</para>
              <para>Anaerobic fitness works differently to aerobic fitness. It is an activity that requires high levels of strength and is done for only a very short period of time at a high level of intensity. Anaerobic fitness may be defined as higher levels of muscular strength, speed and power.</para>
              <para>Flexibility refers to the ability to move the limbs and joints into specific positions at the extreme of their normal range of movement. Flexibility is important as it will allow the body to work in cramped positions without unduly stressing the muscles, tendons and ligaments and may reduce the risk of injury.</para>
              <para>2.Definitions</para>
              <para>For the purpose of this guidance, the following definitions can be considered:</para>
              <para>&#8216;Assessment&#8217; refers to the conclusion on the medical fitness of a person based on the evaluation of the applicant&#8217;s medical history, medical examinations and medical tests which are performed.</para>
              <para>&#8216;Medical staff&#8217; refers to general medical practitioners (GMPs) and occupational health medical practitioners (OHMPs) who have appropriate qualifications and/or experience in the field of occupational medicine practice or aeromedical examiners (AMEs) or aeromedical centres (AeMCs).</para>
              <para>&#8216;Significant&#8217; refers to a degree of a medical condition, the effect of which would prevent the safe performance of duties related to rescue and firefighting.</para>
              <para>3.Medical confidentiality</para>
              <para>All persons involved in medical examinations and assessments ensure that medical confidentiality is respected at all times. For this reason, all reports and records are to be securely held with accessibility restricted only to authorised personnel.</para>
              <para>4.Decrease in medical fitness</para>
              <para>Rescue and firefighting personnel need to exercise a duty of care and not to perform their duties when they are aware of any decrease in their medical fitness, to the extent that this condition might render them unable to perform their duties. Furthermore, without undue delay, medical advice is needed when they:</para>
              <para>(a)have undergone a surgical operation or invasive procedure;</para>
              <para>(b)have commenced the regular use of any medication;</para>
              <para>(c)have suffered any significant personal injury;</para>
              <para>(d)have been suffering from any significant illness;</para>
              <para>(e)are pregnant; and</para>
              <para>(f)have been admitted to hospital or medical clinic.</para>
              <para>In these cases, the medical fitness of the person is assessed by medical staff in order to decide whether the person is fit to resume duties. Additionally, following recovery from significant illness or injury, it may be necessary, after recommendation of the medical staff, to undergo any relevant physical fitness tests prior to a return to operational duty.</para>
              <para>5.Medical staff</para>
              <para>(a)Medical examinations and/or assessments are conducted by medical staff who have knowledge of the rescue and firefighting personnel&#8217;s workloads and risk factors.</para>
              <para>(b)When conducting medical examinations and/or assessments, the medical staff member:</para>
              <para>(1)ensures that communication with the person can be established without language barriers; and</para>
              <para>(2)makes the person aware of the consequences of providing incomplete, inaccurate or false statements on their medical history.</para>
              <para>(c)After completion of the medical examinations and/or assessments, the medical staff member:</para>
              <para>(1)advises the person whether they have been assessed as fit or unfit;</para>
              <para>(2)informs the person of any limitation(s) to operational duty;</para>
              <para>(3)completes a medical report;</para>
              <para>(4)informs the person of their responsibilities in the case of decrease in medical fitness; and</para>
              <para>(5)if the person has been assessed as unfit, informs them of their right of a secondary review.</para>
              <para>6.Medical assessment programme</para>
              <para>A medical assessment programme is a tool to promote and facilitate that rescue and firefighting personnel are free of any physical or mental illness, which might lead to incapacitation or inability to perform their assigned duties and responsibilities.</para>
              <para>The programme includes an initial assessment prior to employment and re-examinations at regular intervals. The frequency of the re-examinations may take into account the age of the person, the medical history, etc.</para>
              <para>7.Medical assessment</para>
              <para>(a)The objective of a medical assessment is to assess the physical and mental ability of the rescue and firefighting personnel to:</para>

              <para>(4)effect or side effect of any prescribed or non-prescribed therapeutic, diagnostic or preventive medication taken, which entails a degree of functional incapacity that is likely to interfere with the performance of their duties or could render them likely to become suddenly unable to perform their duties.</para>
              <para>(c)The initial medical assessment includes at least:</para>
              <para>(1)an assessment of the medical history; and</para>

              <para>PHYSICAL FITNESS EVALUATION PROGRAMME</para>
              <para>The physical fitness of rescue and firefighting personnel will be evaluated at regular intervals. For this reason, a physical fitness evaluation programme is necessary.</para>
              <para>The evaluation should be anti-discriminatory, non-punitive or non-competitive. The results of the evaluation may be used to establish the person&#8217;s baseline or measured against the person&#8217;s previous assessments.</para>
              <para>A physical fitness evaluation will also be considered following significant absence, illness or injury prior to a return to operational duty.</para>
              <para>The physical fitness evaluation includes:</para>
              <para>(a)a pre-evaluation health questionnaire;</para>
              <para>(b)an evaluation of aerobic capacity; and</para>
              <para>(c)an evaluation of muscular strength, endurance and flexibility.</para>
              <para>PRE-EVALUATION PROCEDURE</para>
              <para>(a)Rescue and firefighting personnel complete a pre-assessment screening questionnaire to identify contraindications for participation in the fitness assessment.</para>
              <para>(b)If rescue and firefighting personnel have an incapacitating medical problem or a newly acquired chronic medical condition, the physical fitness assessment will be postponed until the rescue and firefighting personnel have been assessed as fit by the medical staff. In such circumstances, the rescue and firefighting personnel are assessed as unfit.</para>
              <para>FITNESS TESTS</para>
              <para>Individual physical fitness is tested as follows:</para>
              <para>(a)Operational fitness tests</para>
              <para>Physical fitness is evaluated using appropriate standard protocols. The physical fitness test ensure that the rescue and firefighting personnel are able to effectively demonstrate the following representative operational competencies:</para>
              <para>(1)Stair or ladder climbing while carrying an additional load;</para>
              <para>(2)Ladder raise and extension;</para>
              <para>(3)Equipment carry;</para>

              <para>(7)Operating in a high temperature environment with breathing apparatus; and</para>
              <para>(8)Aerobic fitness assessment:</para>
              <para>(i)For full operational duties, a VO2 Max of at least the firefighters&#8217; average or better for age and gender and not less than 35 ml/kg/min is recommended.</para>
              <para>(ii)The estimation of VO2 Max may be performed using the following tests</para>
              <para>(A)Shuttle run;</para>
              <para>(B)Validated step test, e.g. Cooper, Chester;</para>
              <para>(C)Cycle ergometer;</para>
              <para>(D)Treadmill; and</para>
              <para>(E)Full spiro-ergometry</para>
              <para>The above functions may be included as part of an operational exercise or carried out separately.</para>
              <para>(b)Simulated operational physical fitness tests</para>
              <para>Tests conducted in an appropriate facility may be used as an alternative for new recruits, untrained personnel or where the operational test is unavailable and where there is evidence that the simulated tests are a reasonable representation of operational tasks. The choice of the appropriate test depends on various aspects such as ease of administration, safety, cost and predictive value. The following methods may be used for the fitness evaluation of rescue and firefighting personnel:</para>
              <para>(1)Muscular strength</para>
              <para>(i)Handgrip dynamometer;</para>

              <para>PURPOSE OF THE DISABLED AIRCRAFT REMOVAL PLAN</para>
              <para>An aircraft removal incident can occur at any time and in any weather conditions with varying degrees of magnitude. The removal incidents can range from minor de-bogging to major events including damaged or missing landing gear. The recovery process may take from a few hours to many days depending on the severity of the occurrence. While recovery incidents cannot be predicted, they can be anticipated and prepared for.</para>
              <para>Disabled aircraft can interfere with the normal operations at an aerodrome, resulting in restrictions, closure of the movement area or parts of it or even the entire aerodrome.</para>
              <para>It is therefore necessary to remove the disabled aircraft in a timely and efficient manner, taking into account safety and operational requirements (e.g. number of movements, single runway operation and other considerations), subject to the approval of the safety investigation authority.</para>
              <para>Generally, the aerodrome operator will play a support role by assisting the aircraft owner or operator in acquiring local resources and coordinating activities on the airport. The aircraft owner or operator is ultimately responsible for removing the disabled aircraft.</para>

              <para>(a)Responsibilities</para>
              <para>(1)Removal of a disabled aircraft or parts thereof. Identify the person or organisation (normally the aircraft owner or operator) responsible for the removal of the aircraft and define the procedures to follow in the event of failure to comply with such directions.</para>
              <para>(2)Notification of the aircraft accident to the safety investigation authority. Identify the person or organisation (normally the aircraft owner or operator or, when this is not possible, the appropriate authority) responsible for notifying the accident to the safety investigation authority (see Regulation (EU) No 376/2014).</para>
              <para>(3)Preservation of aircraft, mail, cargo, and records. Identify the person or organisation (normally the aircraft owner or operator) responsible for preserving, to the extent possible, the aircraft and parts thereof, cargo, mail, and records. Define the procedures to be followed when it is necessary to disturb or move the aircraft or parts thereof, i.e. photographs, marks on the ground and a diagram of the accident site (see Regulation (EU) No 996/2010).</para>

              <para>(3)Aircraft operator. List the actions that are expected to be taken by the aircraft operator when implementing the plan such as:</para>
              <para>(i)arrange for portable stairs and removal of mail, baggage and cargo; it being understood that authority to remove these items must be secured from the safety investigation authority;</para>
              <para>(ii)designate one representative with the authority to make all technical and financial decisions necessary to remove the aircraft;</para>
              <para>(iii)consider designating of a representative to answer any questions from the press and to issue press releases as may be appropriate; and</para>

              <para>(1)Equipment and personnel available</para>
              <para>List the equipment (including information on the type and location of heavy equipment or special units needed and the average time it will take to get them to the airport) and the contact details of the personnel on or in the surrounding of the airport that would be available for the removal operation.</para>
              <para>Most airports find it economically impossible to store all the equipment necessary for the removal of a disabled aircraft. It has been generally agreed that the most feasible approach to the problem is to prepare a plan for the removal of a disabled aircraft and to make arrangements with other aerodromes for pooling the required specialised equipment. Aircraft operators have made arrangements so as to make specialised equipment available on short notice on a worldwide basis, and kits have been strategically placed around the world.</para>
              <para>In addition to the contact details, include information on the availability of human resources for road-making and other duties. The personnel involved in the removal of disabled aircraft possess a level of proficiency that allows them to control a safe aircraft removal operation aircraft.</para>
              <para>(2)Access routes. Include information on access routes to any part of the aerodrome including, if required, special routes for cranes to avoid power lines. A grid map may be useful for this purpose.</para>

            <content>
              <para>GM1 ADR.OPS.B.016(b)(2) Foreign object debris control programme</para>
              <para>FOD PREVENTION &#8212; MEASURES</para>
              <para>FOD may be produced by many activities and may be generated by personnel, aerodrome infrastructure (pavements, lights and signs), the environment (e.g. wind, heavy rain), aircraft, vehicles, or other equipment operating at the aerodrome. The elements below have also the potential to become sources of FOD on an aerodrome.</para>
              <para>(a)Aircraft servicing and maintenance activities</para>
              <para>During the activities related to the aircraft servicing, various types of FOD may be generated and be left or transferred on the apron, service roads, and other operational areas. Such items may include small luggage parts, cabin waste, plastic or metallic items, etc. FOD may also be generated by vehicles or the equipment that operates in these areas.</para>
              <para>To control this type of FOD, measures need to include securing and removing cabin waste from the aircraft stand. Cabin waste would not be left unattended on the apron, especially near aircraft stands. Moreover, cabin waste need not be disposed of using the FOD containers provided, as cabin waste may attract wildlife. To this end, the handling of cabin waste would be organised so that a damage of the rubbish bag is not likely to attract wildlife on the apron.</para>
              <para>Similarly, during aircraft maintenance, FOD may be generated either in the form of waste or small items inadvertently left on the apron such as rivets, bolts, tools, etc. Procedures to address this may include measuring of tools, use of toolboxes, checklists, removal of waste produced upon the completion of the maintenance activities, etc.</para>
              <para>Inspection of the aircraft stand or other areas that may have been used for aircraft servicing or maintenance, before and after the departure of the aircraft is an effective measure. The secure installation of suitable FOD bins, in appropriate locations, for depositing FOD is also an effective preventive measure.</para>
              <para>(b)Cargo areas</para>
              <para>In a cargo area, there is a high potential for blowing debris such as cargo strapping and plastic sheeting. Procedures to contain such debris, possibly by installing (and monitoring) catch fencing where appropriate, may help to control the environment. FOD trapped by such fences should be removed regularly.</para>
              <para>(b)Construction activities</para>
              <para>During construction activities, several materials (rocks, tools, vehicle parts, etc.) have the potential to become FOD if transferred by vehicles, weather phenomena, etc. on the movement area or other operational areas. For this reason, specific FOD prevention procedures need to be established and employed for each construction project. These procedures would be based on the proximity of the construction activities to the movement area and other operational areas, but in general would stress containment and regular cleaning of construction debris.</para>
              <para>Aerodrome pre-construction planning would include means for controlling and containing FOD generated by the construction. This is especially true in high-wind environments where debris is more likely to become airborne.</para>
              <para>The designated routes of construction vehicles on the movement area need to be planned so as to avoid or minimise crossing in critical areas of aircraft operations. If high-risk crossings cannot be avoided, subsequent provisions such as an increased frequency of FOD inspections could be implemented.</para>
              <para>Contractors need to understand and comply with the requirements regarding the control and removal of FOD. To facilitate compliance with these requirements, the aerodrome operator may consider drafting FOD control guidance for all construction projects taking place within the movement area or nearby areas. Standard and project-specific FOD measures include:</para>
              <para>(1)requiring contractors to cover all loads;</para>
              <para>(2)requiring contractors to secure any loose items that could easily blow away or control dust through spraying of water;</para>
              <para>(3)ensuring the proper functioning of storm drains throughout the construction;</para>
              <para>(4)specifying whether any mechanical FOD removal devices will be required;</para>
              <para>(5)specifying how monitoring for FOD hazards will be accomplished; and</para>
              <para>(6)requirements for inspecting and removing FOD from tyres prior to traversing operational areas.</para>
              <para>(d)Aerodrome maintenance operations</para>
              <para>Mowing and other maintenance operations routinely disturb the vegetation and soil in areas adjacent to those travelled by aircraft. Therefore, procedures to remove this debris, such as the use of an assigned aerodrome sweeper or personnel on foot using shovels to repair vegetation and soil, need to be implemented.</para>
              <para>Aerodrome lighting, pavement, and marking maintenance operations may generate concrete/asphalt debris as well as increase the potential for dropped repair parts, tools, and other items stored on the maintenance vehicles. Corrective procedures may include the use of aerodrome sweepers and the inspection of the worksite after maintenance is completed.</para>
              <para>(e)Pavements and other aerodrome surfaces may be prone to generating FOD</para>
              <para>(1)Pavements</para>
              <para>(i)Deteriorating pavements can exhibit spalling or cracks. For example, pieces of concrete can break loose from pavements or FOD can develop from fatigue corner cracks.</para>
              <para>(ii)The service roads that cross taxiways may generate FOD from the vehicles using them, especially in the case of construction operations.</para>
              <para>(iii)Special attention should be paid to the cleaning of cracks and pavement joints.</para>
              <para>(iv)Asphalt and concrete pavements may be the most common source of FOD on an aerodrome; therefore, effective pavement maintenance practices are important for the prevention of FOD.</para>
              <para>(2)Other aerodrome surfaces</para>
              <para>Grass areas and ditches may collect and hold large amounts of light debris such as paper, cardboard, plastic and various containers that can originate from terminal aprons, cargo ramps and hangar ramps. This debris can blow back into areas used by aircraft unless collected in a timely manner.</para>
              <para>Unpaved areas adjacent to pavements may require stabilisation, as appropriate, to prevent FOD from jet wash.</para>
              <para>FOD fences may collect debris on windy days. This FOD would be collected before the wind increases or changes direction and the debris blows back on to areas used by aircraft.</para>
              <para>(f)Vehicle operational activities</para>
              <para>Vehicles used for operational reasons, e.g. preventive maintenance, wildlife management, and which may need to frequently move on surfaces that contain material that could be FOD in the movement area. Thus, procedural (e.g. inspection/cleaning of tyres) or technical (development of surfaces at predetermined points that help the removal of FOD from tyres) measures may be taken to address this potential FOD source.</para>

              <para>(a)FOD detection</para>
              <para>In addition to the standard inspections, personnel on the movement area need to employ a &#8216;clean-as-you-go&#8217; technique, by looking for FOD during their regular duties.</para>
              <para>When inspections occur at night, additional lights/lighting systems on vehicles are beneficial to better detect FOD.</para>
              <para>Whenever possible, vehicles involved in FOD detection activities, are only driven on clean, paved surfaces. If a vehicle needs to be driven on unpaved surfaces, the driver needs to ensure that the vehicle&#8217;s tyres do not transport FOD (e.g. mud or loose stones) back onto the pavement.</para>
              <para>Encouraging the participation of the personnel of other organisations such as air operators, groundhandling companies, air traffic services providers in inspections may reinforce the concept that FOD control is a team effort and demonstrates the aerodrome operator&#8217;s commitment to a FOD-free environment. This practice may help increase familiarity with local aerodrome conditions, and promotes effective communication between the aerodrome operator and its stakeholders.</para>
              <para>(a)FOD removal</para>
              <para>FOD may be removed either manually or by using mechanical equipment, such as sweepers, vacuum systems, jet air blowers, magnetic bars, FOD &#8216;sweeping carpets&#8217;, etc.</para>
              <para>FOD containers need to be able to withstand strong winds and be of a &#8216;closed-type&#8217; to prevent the wind from dislodging their content. Suggested locations for FOD containers are: near all entry points to the apron area, in hangars, aircraft maintenance areas, near aircraft stands and baggage areas. Clearly identified FOD storage locations increase the likelihood that collected debris will be deposited by personnel. Access to the FOD containers needs to be free by other objects.</para>

              <para>TRAINING OF DRIVERS &#8212; GENERAL</para>
              <para>(a)The training programme that drivers need to follow should depend on the areas where they need to be operating. The following two training programmes should be developed:</para>
              <para>(1)General driving training programme</para>
              <para>This training should cover the needs of all drivers operating on the apron area and other operational areas of the aerodrome. The successful completion of this training grants a driver the right to operate unescorted a vehicle on aprons and other operational areas of the aerodrome, except on the manoeuvring area.</para>
              <para>(2)Manoeuvring area training programme</para>
              <para>This training should cover the additional specific needs of the drivers who will be operating on the manoeuvring area. A driver is granted the right to operate unescorted on the manoeuvring area subject to the:</para>
              <para>(i)provisions of ADR.OPS.B.024(a)(4) and AMC3&#160;ADR.OPS.B.024(b);</para>
              <para>(ii)successful completion of the general driving training programme; and</para>
              <para>(iii)successful completion of the manoeuvring area training programme.</para>
              <para>(b)Each of the above-mentioned training programmes (general driving training programme and manoeuvring area training programme) should consist of the following parts:</para>
              <para>(1)Theoretical training</para>
              <para>The theoretical training should be of a defined and adequate duration, supported by suitable educational means and material.</para>
              <para>The theoretical training should be followed by an assessment of the trainees (see AMC1&#160;ADR.OR.D.017(e)). Once the theoretical part has been successfully completed, the driver should undertake practical training.</para>
              <para>(2)Practical training</para>
              <para>During the phase of the practical training, which needs to be of a defined and adequate duration, the trainees should be provided with adequate practical training and familiarisation with the aerodrome facilities and its procedures by the nominated instructors, in day and, if relevant, night conditions.</para>
              <para>Following the delivery of the practical training, the competence of the trainees should be assessed, in practical terms, by the nominated assessors (see AMC1&#160;ADR.OR.D.017(e)). This assessment should aim at assessing the ability of the trainees to apply, in practice, the knowledge and skills they have acquired through the theoretical and practical training.</para>
              <para>(3)Upon the successful completion of the practical training, and provided that the driver has received training on the use of a vehicle (see AMC1&#160;ADR.OPS.B.024(a)(5)), a driving authorisation should be issued.</para>

              <para>ADR.OPS.B.024 in general addresses the case of authorisation of drivers whose nature of work and activities involves regular presence and driving within the aerodrome environment.</para>
              <para>However, there are cases where it may be necessary to temporarily allow the driving of a vehicle on the movement area or other operational areas of the aerodrome for other reasons (e.g. a contractor&#8217;s vehicle that needs to enter the movement area for maintenance activities taking place at the aerodrome, etc.).</para>
              <para>In cases where the driving on the movement area or other operational areas is necessary but for a limited period of time, the aerodrome operator may permit such driving without requiring the driver to undergo the process for the issuance of an authorisation for the driving of this vehicle. It is expected, however, that before being permitted to operate in such areas, such drivers will be adequately briefed about their obligations while operating within the aerodrome perimeter, and that the aerodrome operator has developed procedures to be implemented during this type of operations.</para>
              <para>In any case, the issuance of such a permit for such a driver does not waive the obligation of the aerodrome operator to ensure:</para>
              <para>the condition of the vehicle that this driver may be temporarily driving into the aerodrome area, in accordance with ADR.OPS.B.026 (e)(2)(i);</para>
              <para>that this vehicle will in any case be escorted. For the characteristics of the vehicle that will be escorting that vehicle, see ADR.OPS.B.026 (e)(2)(ii); and</para>

Where more than one vehicle is used in the same function, then a numbering policy may be used, such that the call sign is followed by a number, e.g. &#8216;Operations 1&#8217;.</para>
              <para>At aerodromes where the number of vehicles and the aircraft traffic is high, before assigning a call sign to a vehicle, it is recommended that the aerodrome operator, apart from the coordination with the air traffic services provider, consults also the other organisations operating vehicles at the aerodrome. As soon as a call sign is assigned to a vehicle, this needs to be known to at least the air traffic services provider.</para>

              <para>(a)Occasional operation of authorised vehicles without radio, transponder or other means supporting surveillance</para>
              <para>The aerodrome operator may decide to permit the occasional operation of vehicles, which have been authorised to be operated on the aerodrome but which are not equipped with a radio, in areas where vehicles are required, by ADR.OPS.B.026&#160;(a)(3), to be equipped with a radio allowing two-way communication with the air traffic services or other aerodrome units, if necessary. The same applies with regard to authorised vehicles, which are not equipped with a transponder or other equipment supporting surveillance as foreseen in ADR.OPS.B.026&#160;(a)(4).</para>
              <para>In this way, occasional unforeseen operational needs that may arise in the context of the operation of the aerodrome may be satisfied, given that such vehicles are not intended to be operated in such areas. However, if such need becomes more frequent, the aerodrome operator may need to consider the equipage of such vehicles with the necessary radio, transponder or other equipment supporting surveillance, considering, amongst others, the benefits that direct communication offers in terms of runway safety, as well as the fact that vehicle surveillance data facilitates the situational awareness of the air traffic services personnel.</para>
              <para>(b)Temporarily permitting vehicle operation</para>
              <para>Vehicles used on the movement area and other operational areas of the aerodrome need to be authorised as per ADR.OPS.B.026&#160;(a). Vehicles may be authorised only if they are used in activities related to the operation of the aerodrome. However, from time to time, and for various reasons, it may be necessary to allow a vehicle to enter the aerodrome area and to be operated on the movement area or other operational areas, for a limited period of time (e.g. transportation of supplies, maintenance activities, transportation of patients, etc.). In such cases, the aerodrome operator may issue a temporary permit for the entry of the vehicle into the aerodrome and its operation in the area necessary.</para>
              <para>In such situations, a visual inspection of the vehicle is necessary, for obvious damages or malfunctions of the vehicle (e.g. leakages, braking system, condition of tyres, lights, etc.) to determine the serviceability of the vehicle.</para>
              <para>(c)Characteristics of escorting vehicles</para>
              <para>A vehicle mentioned in points (a) or (b) above, needs to be escorted by a vehicle equipped with a radio, in accordance with ADR.OPS.B.026&#160;(e)(1)(i) or ADR.OPS.B.026&#160;(e)(2)(b), if it is to be operated:</para>
              <para>(1)on the manoeuvring area; or</para>
              <para>(2)in other areas where vehicles are required to be equipped with a radio (see also point (b) of AMC1&#160;ADR.OPS.B.026(a)(1);(3)).</para>
              <para>In addition, If the escorted vehicle is to be operated on the manoeuvring area, the escorting vehicle would also need to be fitted with a transponder or other equipment supporting surveillance, if so required for the operation of the SMGCS of the aerodrome (see ADR.OPS.B.026(a)(4)).</para>
              <para>Moreover, the escorting vehicle needs to meet at all times the respective marking and lighting requirements for the area(s) where the escorted vehicle will be operating (see ADR.OPS.B.080).</para>
              <para>(d)Operational considerations</para>
              <para>If the vehicle(s) mentioned in points (a) and (b) above is (are) intended to be operated on the manoeuvring area, care is taken to ensure that this is done in compliance with ADR.OPS.B.026&#160;(e)(1)(iii) or ADR.OPS.B.026&#160;(e)(2)(c), as the case may be, as well as the relevant procedures.</para>
              <para>Particular attention needs to be paid to the cases where two or more vehicles are temporarily entering the aerodrome, and especially the manoeuvring area, forming a convoy. In such cases, the escorting vehicles are in positions that allow the monitoring of all escorted vehicles at all times, to ensure that all vehicles comply with the instructions of the air traffic services unit. In addition, attention is necessary to the way and means that the communication between the escorting and the escorted vehicle will be taking place.</para>
              <para>In any case, temporarily permitting the use of the vehicle in accordance with ADR.OPS.B.026&#160;(e)(2), or permitting the operation of an already authorised vehicle in accordance with ADR.OPS.B.026&#160;(e)(1) does not waive the obligation of the aerodrome operator to ensure that the driver of the vehicle holds a permit to temporarily drive into the aerodrome area, or a driving authorisation as the case may be, in accordance with ADR.OPS.B.024.</para>

After landing gear retraction, the frozen slush deposits begin to melt. The resulting liquid flows into the core of the carbon brake, further contaminating the carbon discs.

              <para>The analysis of aeroplane performance data for the purpose of deducing available braking action usually implies the isolation of the total friction force. Either isolating the friction coefficient or comparing the actual stopping capability with a reference capability permits identification of a RWYCC experienced by the aeroplane. Typically, this requires a technical or simulation model of the aeroplane performance produced by the manufacturer. The analysis may be performed through a third party or through the resources of the aeroplane manufacturer. The aeroplane operator planning to perform operations on a specially prepared winter runway needs to set up the arrangement with the aeroplane manufacturer.</para>

              <para>AVAILABLE MEANS USED TO DETERMINE THE RWYCC</para>
              <para>(a)The visual inspection of the movement area to assess the surface condition is the core method to determine the RWYCC. An overall assessment however implies more than that. The continuous monitoring of the development of the situation and the prevailing weather conditions is essential to ensure safe flight operations. Other aspects to be considered in the assessment result are the outside air temperature, the surface temperature, the dew point, the wind speed and direction, the effect of surface treatment, control and deceleration of the inspection vehicle, the special air-reports of braking action, the output from friction measuring devices, the weather forecast, etc. Due to interaction between them, a deterministic method on how these factors affect the RWYCC to be reported cannot be precisely defined.</para>
              <para>(b)The RCAM supports the classification of runway surface conditions by their effect on aeroplane braking performance using a set of criteria identified and quantified based on the best industry knowledge, built upon dedicated flight testing and in-service experience. The thresholds at which a criterion changes the classification of a surface condition are intended to be reasonably conservative, without being excessively pessimistic.</para>
              <para>(c)The following describes why the primary classification criteria in the RCAM have been set this way, and why it is important for aerodrome personnel to monitor and accurately report conditions when operating close to the boundaries of each RWYCC:</para>
              <para>(1)Percentage of coverage with contamination in each runway third</para>
              <para>A runway is considered contaminated whenever the extent of the coverage is more than a quarter of the surface of at least one third of the runway. It is important to note that whenever coverage is assessed to be below the 25 per cent threshold in each third, the computation assumption made by flight crew will be a dry runway (uniformly bare of moisture, water and contamination). It has been demonstrated that in conditions of contamination just below the reporting threshold but concentrated in the most unfavourable location, this assumption of dry runway still provides positive stop margins.</para>
              <para>(2)Type of contaminant</para>
              <para>Different contaminants affect the contact area between tyre and runway surface, where the stopping force is generated, in different ways. A water film of any depth leads to the partial (viscous aquaplaning) or total separation (dynamic aquaplaning) of the tyre from the surface. The smaller the surface, the smaller the force of adhesion, the less braking is available. Therefore, the maximum braking force decreases at higher speed and depends on contaminant depth. Other fluid contaminants have a similar effect. Hard contaminants, such as ice or compacted snow, prevent the contact between tyre and runway surface completely and at any speed, effectively providing a new surface that the tyre rolls on. A deterministic classification of the stopping performance can be made only for the contaminants listed in the RCAM. For other reportable contaminants (oil, mud, ash, etc.), a large variance in the aeroplane performance effect exists, or insufficient data is available to permit a deterministic classification. An exception is rubber contamination, for which in-service data indicates that an assumption of RWYCC 3 provides a satisfactory performance margin. Runway surface treatments with sand, grit or chemicals may be very effective or even detrimental depending on the conditions of the application, and no credit can be attributed to such treatment without verification and validation.</para>
              <para>(3)Depth of the contamination</para>
              <para>The industry accepts that the threshold for the effect of depth of fluid contaminants on aeroplane performance is at 3 mm. Below this threshold, any type of fluid contaminant can be removed from the tyre/runway contact zone either by forced drainage or by compressing it into the macrotexture of the surface, thus allowing adhesion between tyre and surface to exist, albeit on less than the full footprint surface area. This is the reason why contamination depths up to 3 mm are expected to provide similar stopping performance as a wet runway. It should be noted that the physical effects causing reduced friction forces begin to take effect from very small film thickness, therefore damp conditions are considered to provide no better braking action than a wet runway. Aerodrome personnel need to be aware of the fact that the capability to generate friction in wet (or with thin layers of fluid contaminants) conditions is very dependent upon the inherent qualities of the runway surface (friction characteristics) and may be less than normally expected on poorly drained, polished or rubber contaminated surfaces. Above the 3 mm threshold, the impact on friction forces is more significant, leading to classification in lower RWYCCs. Above this depth, and depending on the density of the fluid, additional drag effects start to apply, due to displacement or compression of the fluid and impingement on the airframe of the aeroplane. These latter effects depend on the depth of the fluid and affect the ability of the aeroplane to accelerate for take-off.</para>
              <para>(4)Surface or air temperature</para>
              <para>It is self-evident that close to the freezing point significant changes in surface conditions can occur very quickly. Surface temperature is more significant for the relevant physical effects, and surface and air temperature may be significantly different due to latency and radiation. However, surface temperature may not be readily available, and it is acceptable to use air temperature as a criterion for the contaminant classification. The threshold for the classification of compacted snow in RWYCC 4 (below OAT -15 degrees) or RWYCC 3 (above this temperature) is based on historical North American operational practice and may be very conservative, therefore other assessment means should be used to support the classification. Such assessment means should be based upon specific rationale, specific procedures and substantiating aeroplane data.</para>

              <para>(a)When the runway third contains a single contaminant, the RWYCC for that third is based directly on that contaminant in the RCAM as follows:</para>
              <para>(1)If the contaminant coverage for that third is less than 10 per cent, a RWYCC 6 is to be generated for that third, and no contaminant is to be reported. If all thirds have less than 10 per cent contaminant coverage, no report is generated; or</para>
              <para>(2)If the contaminant coverage for that third is greater than or equal to 10 per cent and less than or equal to 25 per cent, a RWYCC 6 is to be generated for that third and the contaminant reported at 25 per cent coverage; or</para>

              <para>Figure 1: Single contaminant</para>
              <para>(b)If multiple contaminants are present where the total coverage is more than 25 per cent but no single contaminant covers more than 25 per cent of any runway third, the RWYCC is based upon the judgement of the runway inspector, considering what contaminant will most likely be encountered by the aeroplane and its likely effect on the aeroplane&#8217;s performance. Typically, this would be the most widespread contaminant, but this is not an absolute.</para>
              <para>(c)The structure of the RCAM is ranking the contaminants in the column &#8216;Runway surface description&#8217; from top to bottom and is having the most slippery contaminants at the bottom. However, this ranking is not an absolute, as the RCAM by design is landing oriented and if judged in a take-off scenario, the ranking could be different due to drag effects of loose contaminants.</para>

Upgrading is applicable only when the initial RWYCC is 0 or 1. Upgrading can only occur up to RWYCC 3.</para>
              <para>(d)When upgrading RWYCC 0 and 1, a preponderance of evidence needs to exist pointing towards the higher RWYCC.</para>
              <para>(e)When a friction measuring device is used for upgrading purposes, a preponderance of evidence needs to exist. In order to upgrade a RWYCC 0 or 1 to no higher than RWYCC 3, the friction measuring device needs to demonstrate an equivalent friction to that of a wet runway (RWYCC&#160;5) or higher.</para>

              <para>USE OF SPECIAL AIR-REPORTS</para>
              <para>Special air-reports typically provide aerodrome personnel and other pilots with an observation that can confirm the ground-based assessment of or alert to degraded conditions experienced in terms of braking capability and/or lateral control during the landing roll. The braking action observed is dependent on the type of aircraft, aircraft weight, runway portion used for braking, and other factors. Pilots will use the terms GOOD, GOOD TO MEDIUM, MEDIUM, MEDIUM TO POOR, POOR and LESS THAN POOR. When receiving a special air-report, the recipient needs to consider that it rarely applies to the full length of the runway and is limited to the specific sections of the runway surface in which sufficient wheel braking was applied to reach friction limitation. As special air-reports are subjective and contaminated runways may affect the performance of different aeroplane types in a different way, the reported braking action may not be directly applicable to another aeroplane.</para>

              <para>When lights are used to mark temporary unserviceable areas at night or during reduced visibility conditions, these lights mark the most potentially dangerous extremities of the area. A minimum of four such lights could be used, except where the area is triangular in shape where a minimum of three lights may be employed. The number of lights may be increased when the area is large or of unusual configuration. At least one light should be installed for each 7.5&#160;m of peripheral distance of the area. If the lights are directional, they should be orientated so that, as far as possible, their beams are aligned in the direction from which aircraft or vehicles will approach. Where aircraft or vehicles will normally approach from several directions, consideration should be given to adding extra lights or using omnidirectional lights to show the area from these directions. Unserviceable area lights should be frangible. Their height should be sufficiently low to preserve clearance for propellers and for engine pods of jet aircraft.</para>

                    <para>OVERLOAD OPERATIONS</para>
                    <para>(a)Overloading of pavements can result either from loads too large, or from a substantially increased application rate, or both. Loads larger than the defined (design or evaluation) load shorten the design life, whilst smaller loads extend it. With the exception of massive overloading, pavements in their structural behaviour are not subject to a particular limiting load above which they suddenly or catastrophically fail. Behaviour is such that a pavement can sustain a definable load for an expected number of repetitions during its design life. As a result, occasional minor overloading is acceptable, when expedient, with only limited loss in pavement life expectancy, and relatively small acceleration of pavement deterioration. For those operations in which magnitude of overload and/or the frequency of use do not justify a detailed analysis, the following criteria are suggested:</para>
                    <para>(1)for flexible pavements, occasional movements by aircraft with ACN not exceeding 10&#160;% above the reported PCN should not adversely affect the pavement;</para>
                    <para>(2)for rigid or composite pavements, in which a rigid pavement layer provides a primary element of the structure, occasional movements by aircraft with ACN not exceeding 5&#160;% above the reported PCN should not adversely affect the pavement;</para>
                    <para>(3)if the pavement structure is unknown, the 5&#160;% limitation should apply; and</para>
                    <para>(4)the annual number of overload movements should not exceed approximately 5&#160;% of the total annual aircraft movements.</para>
                    <para>(b)Such overload movements should not normally be permitted on pavements exhibiting signs of distress or failure. Furthermore, overloading should be avoided during any periods of thaw following frost penetration, or when the strength of the pavement or its subgrade could be weakened by water. Where overload operations are conducted, the aerodrome operator should review the relevant pavement condition regularly, and should also review the criteria for overload operations periodically since excessive repetition of overloads can cause severe shortening of pavement life, or require major rehabilitation of pavement.</para>

              <para>RUNWAY SURFACE EVENNESS</para>
              <para>(a)The operation of aircraft and differential settlement of surface foundations will eventually lead to increases in surface irregularities. Small deviations in the above tolerances will not seriously hamper aircraft operations. In general, isolated irregularities of the order of 2.5&#160;cm to 3&#160;cm over a 45&#160;m-distance are acceptable, as shown in Figure 1. Although maximum acceptable deviations vary with the type and speed of an aircraft, the limits of acceptable surface irregularities can be estimated to a reasonable extent. The following table describes acceptable, tolerable and excessive limits:</para>
              <para>Table 1</para>
              <para>(1)If the surface irregularities exceed the heights defined by the acceptable limit curve but are less than the heights defined by the tolerable limit curve, at the specified minimum acceptable length, herein noted by the tolerable region, then maintenance action should be planned. The runway may remain in service. This region is the start of possible passenger and pilot discomfort.</para>
              <para>(2)If the surface irregularities exceed the heights defined by the tolerable limit curve, but are less than the heights defined by the excessive limit curve, at the specified minimum acceptable length, herein noted by the excessive region, the maintenance corrective action is mandatory to restore the condition to the acceptable region. The runway may remain in service but should be repaired within a reasonable period. This region could lead to the risk of possible aircraft structural damage due to a single event or fatigue failure over time.</para>
              <para>(3)If the surface irregularities exceed the heights defined by the excessive limit curve, at the specified minimum acceptable length, herein noted by the unacceptable region, then the area of the runway where the roughness has been identified warrants closure. Repairs are required to restore the condition within the acceptable limit region and the aircraft operators may be advised accordingly. This region runs the extreme risk of a structural failure and must be addressed immediately.</para>
              <para>(b)The term &#8216;surface irregularity&#8217; is defined herein to mean isolated surface elevation deviations that do not lie along a uniform slope through any given section of a runway. For the purposes of this concern, a &#8216;section of a runway&#8217; is defined herein to mean a segment of a runway throughout which a continuing general uphill, downhill, or flat slope is prevalent. The length of this section is generally between 30 and 60&#160;m, and can be greater, depending on the longitudinal profile and the condition of the pavement.</para>
              <para>(c)The maximum tolerable step-type bump, such as that which could exist between adjacent slabs, is simply the bump height corresponding to zero bump length at the upper end of the tolerable region of the roughness criteria of Figure 1.</para>
              <para>(d)Deformation of the runway with time may also increase the possibility of the formation of water pools. Pools as shallow as approximately 3&#160;mm in depth, particularly if they are located where they are likely to be encountered at high speed by landing aeroplanes, can induce aquaplaning which can then be sustained on a wet runway by a much shallower depth of water. Improved guidance regarding the significant length and depth of pools relative to aquaplaning is the subject of further research. It is, of course, especially necessary to prevent pools from forming whenever there is a possibility that they might become frozen.</para>
              <para>(e)Macrotexture and microtexture are taken into consideration in order to provide the required surface friction characteristics. This normally requires some form of special surface treatment.</para>

              <para>TREND MONITORING PROGRAMME</para>
              <para>(a)The objective of the trend monitoring programme is to ensure that the surface friction characteristics for the entire runway remain at or above the minimum standards, to avoid the runway becoming slippery wet.</para>
              <para>(b)Degradation is typically caused by rubber deposits, surface polishing or poor drainage. These can be mitigated as follows:</para>
              <para>(1)Accumulation trend of rubber can be managed through a rubber removal programme.</para>
              <para>(2)Polishing trend of the surface can be managed by monitoring loss of sharpness and retexturing/resurfacing programme.</para>
              <para>(3)Drainage trend can be managed by monitoring changes in geometry and blocking of drainage channels and reshaping programme.</para>
              <para>(c)In the construction of new runways or the resurfacing of existing runways, the construction of surfaces with adequate slopes and aggregate of angular fragments from crushed gravel or stone so as to provide a sharp texture will help to ensure surface friction characteristics providing good braking action in wet conditions.

              <para>(d)The determination that a runway or portion thereof is slippery wet stems from various methods used by themselves or in combination. Additionally, substandard runways or portion thereof can be identified through repeated reports by aeroplane operators based upon flight crew experience or through analysis of aeroplane stopping performance.

              <para>FRICTION EVALUATIONS WITH CONTINUOUS FRICTION MEASURING DEVICES</para>
              <para>(a)The lateral location on the runway for performing friction measurements is based on the type and/or mix of aircraft operating on the runway:</para>
              <para>(1)For runways serving only narrow-body aircraft, friction measurements are conducted 3 m to 5 m from the runway centre line.</para>
              <para>(2)For runways serving narrow-body and wide-body aircraft, friction measurements are conducted 3 m and 6 m from the runway centre line to determine the worst-case condition. If the worst-case condition is found to be consistently to one track, future measurements may be limited to this track. Care needs to be exercised, however, to account for any future and/or seasonal changes in aircraft mix.</para>
              <para>(b)The measurements are performed using a self-wetting continuous friction measuring device on a dry runway surface.</para>
              <para>(c)Interpretation of comparative self-wetting friction measurements</para>
              <para>(1)The texture of the tyre pavement contact patch area in direct contact with aircraft tyre penetrates the rubber of the aircraft tyre and creates horizontal forces in the aircraft tyre and creates grip. Grip is a micro-movement of the rubber over the texture indenting the rubber. This micro-movement is called slippage. On a free-rolling aircraft tyre, there is no relative movement between the aircraft tyre and the pavement regardless of the rolling speed. The amount of exposed texture, and the quality thereof, both micro and macrotexture, defines the ability of the pavement surface to create wet grip performance of the aircraft tyre.</para>
              <para>(2)If the aircraft wheel is braked and the horizontal forces applied on the aircraft tyre are higher than those produced by the grip, the aircraft tyre starts to skid.</para>
              <para>(3)The friction coefficient that can be calculated is a dynamic friction coefficient. The dynamic friction coefficient is lower than the static friction coefficient (maximum tyre grip that can be achieved). Related to stopping performance of the aircraft, the operation has become friction-limited when a tyre starts skidding.</para>
              <para>(4)The basic assumption for the using a self-wetting continuous friction measuring device with a forced skid is to mirror a braked skidding aircraft tyre on a wet pavement surface. This is an oversimplification since the aircraft tyres are controlled by an anti-skid system and the friction measuring devices operate at a fixed slip.</para>
              <para>(5)It is noted that friction measuring device values are not used to determine and report surface conditions. Joint industry and multi-national government tests have notestablished a reliable correlation between runway friction values and the relationship to aeroplane braking performance. However, the measured values can be used in a comparative way to support other survey information collected.</para>
              <para>(6)The measured friction coefficient is a dynamic friction coefficient where the surfaces are forced to be in relative motion regardless of the measuring speed. The degree of relative motion is friction measuring device-specific.</para>
              <para>(7)A complete survey is, as a minimum, performed at speeds of 65 km/h and 95 km/h.</para>
              <para>(8)The measured value is an indication of the overall texture, contaminant and drainage capability of the pavement surface in the tyre pavement contact patch area of a skidding tyre. No single capability can be extracted but certain qualities can be deduced from comparative measurements using the same friction measurement device on the same surface.</para>
              <para>(9)The measured values are to be compared with measured values from previous surveys in order to monitor the trend of the texture, contaminant and drainage characteristics of the runway pavement.</para>
              <para>(i)Texture</para>
              <para>(A)At low speed, the microtexture of the aggregates in the tyre pavement contact patch area penetrates the residual water film between the pavement and the rubber. These are qualities associated with 65 km/h. Lower comparative values at low speed indicate reduced exposed microtexture and are indicative of microtexture cover-up (rubber) and polishing of aggregates.</para>
              <para>(B)At higher speed,themicrotexture may not penetrate the residual water film. As speed increases, the residual water film may become thicker and reduce the amount of microtexture that penetrates the water film. If no microtexture penetrates the water film, there is no effect of the microtexture on the performance of the aircraft tyre. The tyre then goes into an aquaplaning mode with no stopping and directional control capability. These are qualities associated with 95 km/h, and lower comparative values are indicative of the combined rubber build-up and reduced drainage capability.</para>
              <para>(C)Macrotexture creates escape channels for bulk water and reduces the susceptibility of the pavement surface to build up water films under the aircraft tyre. Lower comparative values at high speed indicate reduced macrotexture.</para>
              <para>(ii)Contaminant</para>
              <para>(A)The most common contaminant to consider is the build-up of rubber. Build&#8211; up of rubber reduces the amount of exposed microtexture and the fill-up of the macrotexture, and thereby reduces the drainage capability of the pavement in the tyre pavement contact patch area. Affected areas can readily be identified by the eye.</para>
              <para>(B)If the aerodrome operator suspects that the runway has a microtexture problem, this can be identified by the touch; pavement surface does feel &#8216;sandpapery&#8217;. This applies to both rubber build-up, where the aggregates get covered, and the polishing of aggregates.</para>
              <para>(C)For interpretation of comparative measurements on rubber built-up areas, see (i) Texture above.</para>
              <para>(10)Drainage</para>
              <para>(i)The aircraft tyres&#8217; contribution to drainage is the drainage through the longitudinal grooves. The pavements&#8217; contribution is the drainage through their macrotexture. This drainage can be in all directions, and in the case of porous friction course drainage downwards, through the porous friction course layer itself. If the pavement is transverse grooved, the drainage in the transverse direction of travel is enhanced. Lower comparative values at high speed indicate reduced drainage capability under the aircraft tyre and reduced macrotexture.</para>
              <para>(ii)It should be noted that the effects of drainage defects,such as ponding and rutting, will not be detected by comparative measurements by self-wetting continuous friction measuring devices. As the self-wetting continuous friction measurements are performed on a dry runway, there will be no ponding, nor any water stream in any rutting if the runway has such defects.</para>

              <para>(b)The aerodrome operator should not permit overload operations on pavements exhibiting signs of distress or failure. Furthermore, overload operations should be avoided during any periods of thaw following frost penetration, or when the strength of the pavement or its subgrade could be weakened by water. Where overload operations are conducted, the aerodrome operator should review the relevant pavement condition regularly, and should review the criteria for overload operations periodically, since repetition of overloads can cause severe shortening of pavement life or require major rehabilitation of pavement.</para>

              <para>LED LIGHTS &#8212; MAINTENANCE PROGRAMME &#8212; ICING AND SNOWING CONDITIONS</para>
              <para>(a)The energy savings of light emitting diodes (LEDs) are due in large part to the fact that they do not produce the infrared heat signature of incandescent lamps.</para>
              <para>Thus, operators of aerodromes with presence of ice or snow, who have come to expect their melting by this heat signature, need to evaluate whether or not a modified maintenance schedule is required during such conditions, or evaluate the possible operational value of installing LED fixtures with heating elements. Manufacturers can provide a heater, sometimes referred to as an &#8216;arctic kit&#8217;, for their LED light units. Whether a heater is needed is dependent upon the site location and the weather conditions to which it is exposed. In some instances, the low-operating temperature is an advantage in that drifting snow does not melt and attach itself to the fixture lens. It is likely that LED PAPI will require some form of lens heater regardless of site location to ensure that condensation/icing does not occur.</para>
              <para>(b)While LEDs could last for many thousands of hours under certain conditions, the life of the LED itself, and more importantly, that of the complete luminaire including the electronics, still depends on the system integration and the actual conditions in which the luminaire is used. Application conditions that could have an impact on the expected life of the luminaire include, primarily, the temperature of operation, on-off cycling patterns and humidity. Because LEDs do not have filaments that break or deteriorate, when operated under normal conditions, theytend to last for a long time. However, their light output decreases and the colour of their light shifts over time, with the rate of depreciation increasing at higher-operating temperatures. The implication for practice is that at some point in time the loss of light output or the colour shift may render the LED source outside the specifications for a given application or purpose; while the LEDs may technically still be operating, they would no longer be considered useful.</para>
              <para>Therefore, the long life of the LED in comparison to that of an incandescent lamp may not be taken as a reason for &#8216;install and forget&#8217;. A system of preventive maintenance is necessary as the LED light does eventually fail. In addition, there are other factors that can reduce performance, such as contamination on the lens of in-pavement fixtures.</para>

              <para>The aerodrome operator needs, however, to consider defining, as part of its maintenance programme, two levels of intensity for individual lights, i.e. a maintenance level and the unserviceability level.</para>
              <para>The higher level gives aerodrome maintenance personnel advance warning that a light unit is beginning to produce an output significantly below the required value. This level is always above 50 per cent of the specified intensity, which is the level at which the light is classified as being outside specification tolerance and therefore to have failed from an operational perspective. Once the light output reaches the maintenance level, corrective action can be scheduled. This prevents lights from losing performance to the level where immediate maintenance action must be taken.</para>

              <para>(a)As part of the maintenance programme, the lighting system maintenance activities should include ground checks. During the daily checks, the lighting systems should be checked at least for light failures, breakage or gross misalignment and correct operation of the intensity control system.</para>
              <para>The maintenance programme should identify the frequency of other checks that need to be performed throughout the year, as well as their content. Moreover, irrespective of the runway type, the aerodrome operator should ensure the serviceability of the lights by conducting photometric measurements, at appropriate intervals, as part of the maintenance programme.</para>
              <para>(b)Ground checks of visual approach slope indicator systems (VASIS) should determine their alignment and serviceability. The alignment of VASIS should be checked at defined intervals, taking into account environmental conditions (e.g. rain, drought, etc.) that may affect the stability of the system, using an appropriate intensity setting. Additional checks should be conducted following an aircraft occurrence. Errors in excess of one minute of arc should be corrected. The maintenance programme should also cover the obstacle protection surface of the VASIS to ensure that it is clear of all obstacles.</para>
              <para>The serviceability of VASIS should be checked on each runway inspection. With regard to serviceability of the precision approach path indicator (PAPI) and abbreviated precision approach path indicator (APAPI), a unit should be considered to be unserviceable if more than one light is unserviceable and the unit consists of three or more lights; or at least one light is unserviceable and the unit consists of less than three lights. In addition, whenever a red filter does not produce the correct colour light beam, is missing, or is damaged, all the lights associated with that filter should be extinguished until the red filter is rectified.</para>
              <para>(c)For a precision approach runway category II or III:</para>
              <para>(1)The system of preventive maintenance employed should include at least the following checks:</para>

              <para>(ii)control and measurement of the electrical characteristics of each circuitry included in the approach and runway lighting systems; and</para>

              <para>(2)In-field measurement of intensity, beam spread and orientation of lights included in approach and runway lighting systems should be undertaken by measuring all lights, as far as practicable, to ensure conformance with the appropriate figure in CS&#160;ADRDSN.U.940.</para>
              <para>(3)Measurement of intensity, beam spread and orientation of lights included in approach and runway lighting systems should be undertaken using an appropriate measuring unit of sufficient accuracy to analyse the characteristics of the individual lights.</para>
              <para>(4)The frequency of measurement should be based on traffic density, the local pollution level, the reliability of the installed lighting equipment and the continuous assessment of the results of the in-field measurements but, in any event, should not be less than twice a year for in-pavement lights and not less than once a year for other lights.</para>

              <para>(d)As part of the maintenance programme of the lighting systems, flight check of the approach, runway and taxiway lighting systems, VASIS, aerodrome beacon, and the light intensity control system should be carried out at regular intervals, at least on a yearly basis, to ensure that the pattern is correct and that lights are operating properly. Special flight checks should be arranged in case of major maintenance of, or changes to, such systems, as well as before the commissioning of new systems, both at day and night.</para>

              <para>(i)condition of structure and the foundation of each unit.</para>
              <para>GROUND CHECKS &#8212;VASIS</para>
              <para>VASIS are used in order to provide correct visual glide slope indication to the flight crews in all variable weather conditions, by day and by night. It is therefore imperative that the maintenance programme ensures the correct alignment of the system, as well as its serviceability at all times. In order to achieve this, a suitable maintenance programme, including the correct frequency of ground checks, needs to be developed and implemented.</para>
              <para>During daily checks, the general condition of each unit is checked to determine the following:</para>
              <para>(a)all lights are lighted and illuminated evenly;</para>
              <para>(b)there is no evidence of apparent damages;</para>
              <para>(c)the change from red to white is coincident for all elements in a unit; and</para>
              <para>(d)the lenses are not contaminated.</para>
              <para>Regarding the alignment of VASIS, the individual unit setting angles are checked by means of angular measurement, in accordance with the manufacturer&#8217;s instructions. A visual comparison between all the units in the system set at the same angle may be used to identify a unit in which there is a misalignment between the optical system and the datum plate. The cause of any misalignment of this nature needs to be ascertained and corrected before any adjustment is made to the setting angles.</para>
              <para>Where the ground where the VASIS are installed is less stable, or intense weather phenomena such as frost, heavy rain or drought take place, or variations in weather occur, the aerodrome operator needs to adjust the ground checks of the VASIS, as such phenomena may lead to misalignment of the VASIS. In this way, gross alignment errors may be prevented.</para>
              <para>FLIGHT CHECKS</para>
              <para>Flight checks for precision approach runways aremore frequent and detailed than other runway types.</para>
              <para>Lights are checked for failures and alignment, while the VASIS are also be checked for correct approach slope, and compatibility with the non-visual aids, if available. Moreover, the balance of light intensity, at all intensity settings, needs to be checked.</para>
              <para>During daylight flight checks, an assessment of the markings needs also to take place.</para>
              <para>Flight checks may be arranged to be conducted with the planned calibration flights of the no-visual aids. The opportunity is also be taken to identify any confusing or misleading lights in the aerodrome surroundings.</para>

              <para>Whenever, for maintenance or other purposes (e.g. relocation of markings, redesign of pavements), a marking on the movement area is not needed any longer, the marking should be physically removed. In no case should a non-needed marking be painted over.</para>
              <para>The removal of the marking may be accomplished by using various techniques, but irrespectively of the technique used, it should not cause damage to the pavement or parts of the lighting systems.</para>
              <para>In order to eliminate the visual appearance of the removed marking(s) on the pavement, the physical removal of any old marking(s) should include a predetermined larger size and shape of the area occupied by the marking(s), that encompasses the old marking(s), and by grouping adjacent markings together into a larger rectangular removal area.</para>

              <para>REMOVAL OF MARKINGS</para>
              <para>A marking may need to be removed for various reasons (marking patterns are changed, physical areas or operating procedures are modified, or the thickness of the layers of paint becomes excessive, etc.)</para>
              <para>It has been found that covering markings that need to be removed, with a darker colour (e.g. black or dark grey) in order to make them resemble the colour of the adjacent pavement (e.g. runway, apron, taxiway) is likely to mislead the flight crews, as well as drivers operating in this area because of the reflection of the sun or other sources of light upon the new surface. Moreover, the surface layer of paint will wear away or erode and the lower layers will become visible and this may cause confusion.</para>
              <para>Methods used for removing unnecessary markings include but are not limited to water blasting, sand blasting, chemical removal, burning, etc.</para>
              <para>If the sand blasting method is used, arrangements are necessary to remove the sand deposited on the pavement as the work progresses, in order to prevent accumulation.</para>
              <para>Grinding is not recommended because of the damage to the pavement surface and probable reduction of the friction characteristics.</para>
              <para>When chemicals are used for marking removal, a large and continuous source of water is usually needed to reduce potential damage to pavement surfaces and to dilute the chemicals washed into drains or channels. Prior to the use of chemicals, consideration is necessary to the applicable environmental protection requirements.</para>
              <para>If burning is used to remove a marking, care is necessary not to damage the pavement surface, as a result of the extended periods of exposure to the heat source.</para>
              <para>Examples of predetermined areas that should cover the area of the old marking(s), as well as adjacent markings, appear in Figure 1.</para>

However, the aerodrome operator remains ultimately responsible for ensuring that safety is maintained.</para>

              <para>Foreknowledge of the limitations to the operations at the apron will help maintain safety. The requirement to establish a process for disseminating operational information does not necessarily mean that the aerodrome operator has to develop a technical system specific to a particular aerodrome. The methods and the means selected depend on the complexity of the aerodrome, the number of organisations or apron users that have to be informed, existing systems, etc.</para>

              <para>At an aerodrome that falls within the scope of the Basic Regulation and has more than one runway, at least one runway should meet the criteria contained in Article 2 of the Basic Regulation. However, it is not compulsory for other &#8216;types&#8217; of runways at an aerodrome to meet the criteria of Article 2 of the Basic Regulation. Such runways may be non-instrument runways, unpaved runways, shorter than 800&#160;m runways, runways which are not open to public use or for commercial air transport. The certification specifications and guidance material are applicable also to those runways.</para>

              <para>GM1 ADR-DSN.A.005&#160;Aerodrome reference code (ARC)</para>
              <para>(a)The intent of the reference code is to provide a simple method for interrelating the numerous specifications concerning the characteristics of aerodromes so as to provide a series of aerodrome facilities that are suitable for the aeroplanes that are intended to operate at the aerodrome. The code is not intended to be used for determining runway length or pavement strength requirements. The code is composed of two elements which are related to the aeroplane performance characteristics and dimensions.</para>
              <para>(b)Element 1 is a number based on the aeroplane reference field length, and element 2 is a letter based on the aeroplane wingspan. The code letter or number within an element selected for design purposes is related to the critical aeroplane characteristics for which the facility is provided. When applying CS-ADR-DSN text, the aeroplanes which the aerodrome is intended to serve, are first identified and then the two elements of the code.</para>
              <para>(c)In addition to the reference code, other aircraft characteristics, such as aircraft length and tail height, may also have an impact on the design of an aerodrome. Additionally, some characteristics of a piece of infrastructure are directly related to one element of the code (wingspan or wheel span) but are not impacted by other. The aerodrome designer should consider all the relationships between aircraft characteristics and aerodromes and piece of infrastructures characteristics.</para>
              <para>(d)It is not intended that the specifications deriving from the aerodrome reference code limit or regulate the operation of an aircraft.</para>
              <para>(e)It is recognised that not all areas of the aerodrome should need to correspond to the critical aeroplane that determines the Aerodrome Reference Code. Elements of the aerodrome infrastructure that do not meet the requirements of the Aerodrome Reference Code for the design aeroplane should be designated with an appropriate code letter for its dimensions. Limitations should be identified to aircraft size permitted or operating limitations. ICAO, Annex&#160;14 does not provide sufficient flexibility for infrastructure intended for different sizes of aircraft. It only addresses the &#8216;design aircraft&#8217;. This enables all areas of the aerodrome to reflect the aerodrome reference code.</para>
              <para>(f)Further guidance on aerodrome reference code and on planning for aeroplanes with wingspans greater than 80&#160;m is given in ICAO&#160;Doc&#160;9157, Aerodrome Design Manual, Part 1, Runways, and Part 2, Taxiways, Aprons and Holding Bays.</para>
              <para>Additional guidance on determining the runway length is given in ICAO Doc 9157, Aerodrome Design Manual, Part 1, Runways.</para>
              <para>Note: References to the ICAO documents provided in CS-ADR-DSN are made for additional guidance. Changes in the CS-ADR-DSN regarding the aerodrome reference code are not yet fully reflected in these documents.</para>
              <para>(g)In the case of an aeroplane equipped with folding wing tips, its reference code letter may change as a result of the folding/extending of the wing tips. Consideration will be given to the wingspan configuration and resultant operations of the aeroplane at an aerodrome.</para>
              <para>Further information concerning aeroplanes with folding wing tips, physical characteristics, and the concept of normal and non-normal operations can be found in the manufacturer&#8217;s aircraft characteristics for airport planning manual.</para>

              <para>GM1 ADR-DSN.B.015&#160;Number, siting, and orientation of runways</para>
              <para>ED Decision 2017/021/R</para>
              <para>(a)In practice the number and orientation of runways at an aerodrome should normally be such that the usability factor of the aerodrome would normally be not less than 95&#160;% for the aeroplanes that the aerodrome is intended to serve.</para>
              <para>(b)Many factors affect the determination of the orientation, siting, and number of runways:</para>
              <para>(1)The wind distribution (to minimise crosswinds liable to affect runways);</para>
              <para>(i)Wind statistics used for the calculation of the usability factor are normally available in ranges of speed and direction, and the accuracy of the results obtained depends, to a large extent, on the assumed distribution of observations within these ranges. In the absence of any sure information as to the true distribution, it is usual to assume a uniform distribution since, in relation to the most favourable runway orientations, this generally results in a slightly conservative usability factor.</para>
              <para>(ii)The maximum mean crosswind components given in GM1&#160;ADR-DSN.B.020, refer to normal circumstances. There are some factors which may require that a reduction of those maximum values be taken into account at a particular aerodrome. These include:</para>
              <para>A.the wide variations which may exist, in handling characteristics and maximum permissible crosswind components, among diverse types of aeroplanes (including future types) within each of the three groups given in GM1&#160;ADR-DSN.B.020;</para>
              <para>B.prevalence and nature of gusts;</para>
              <para>C.prevalence and nature of turbulence;</para>
              <para>D.the availability of a secondary runway;</para>
              <para>E.the width of runways;</para>
              <para>F.the runway surface conditions &#8212; water, snow, and ice on the runway materially reduce the allowable crosswind component; and</para>
              <para>G.the strength of the wind associated with the limiting crosswind component.</para>
              <para>(2)The need to facilitate the provision of approaches conforming to the approach surface specifications, ensuring that obstacles in these areas or other factors should not restrict the operation of the aeroplanes for which the runway is intended. This may relate to individual obstacles or local geography (e.g. high ground).</para>
              <para>(3)The need to minimise interference with areas approved for residential use and other noise-sensitive areas close to the aerodrome.</para>
              <para>(4)The need to avoid the turbulence impacts of buildings on or close to the aerodrome.</para>
              <para>(5)Type of operation. Attention should be paid in particular to whether the aerodrome is to be used in all meteorological conditions or only in visual meteorological conditions, and whether it is intended for use by day and night, or only by day.</para>
              <para>(6)Topography of the aerodrome site, its approaches, and surroundings, particularly:</para>
              <para>(i)compliance with the obstacle limitation surfaces;</para>
              <para>(ii)current and future land use. The orientation and layout should be selected so as to protect as far as possible, the particularly sensitive areas, such as residential, school and hospital zones, from the discomfort caused by aircraft noise. Detailed information on this topic is provided in ICAO Doc 9184, Airport Planning Manual, Part 2, Land Use and Environmental Control and in ICAO Doc 9829, Guidance on the Balanced Approach to Aircraft Noise Management;</para>
              <para>(iii)current and future runway lengths to be provided;</para>
              <para>(iv)construction costs; and</para>
              <para>(v)possibility of installing suitable non-visual and visual aids for approach-to-land.</para>
              <para>(7)Air traffic in the vicinity of the aerodrome, particularly:</para>
              <para>(i)proximity of other aerodromes or ATS routes;</para>
              <para>(ii)traffic density; and</para>
              <para>(iii)air traffic control and missed approach procedures.</para>
              <para>(c)The number of runways to be provided in each direction depends on the number of aircraft movements to be catered for.</para>
              <para>(d)Whatever the factors that determine the runway orientation, the siting, and orientation of runways at an aerodrome should where possible, be such that safety is optimised.</para>
              <para>(e)One important factor is the usability factor, as determined by the wind distribution which is specified hereunder. Another important factor is the alignment of the runway to facilitate the provision of approaches conforming to the approach surface specifications in CS ADR-DSN.H.425. Further guidance on these and other factors is given in ICAO Annex&#160;14, Attachment&#160;A, Section 1. When a new instrument runway is being located, particular attention needs to be given to areas over which aeroplanes should be required to fly when following instrument approach and missed approach procedures so as to ensure that obstacles in these areas or other factors should not restrict the operation of the aeroplanes for which the runway is intended.</para>
              <para>(f)The selection of data to be used for the calculation of the usability factor should be based on reliable wind distribution statistics that extend over as long a period of time as possible, preferably of not less than five years. The observations used should be made at least eight times daily and spaced at equal intervals of time.</para>

              <para>(b)Where this displacement is due to an unserviceable runway condition, a cleared and graded area of at least 60&#160;m in length should be available between the unserviceable area and the displaced threshold.</para>
              <para>(c)Guidance Material on the survey requirements for aerodromes is provided in the ICAO World Geodetic system &#8211; 1984 (WGS-84) Manual, notably in Section 5.3. However, this guidance does not accurately define the survey locations for the runway edge or the runway threshold because, in both cases, the measurement point is not the centre of the relevant paint marking.</para>
              <para>(d)Location of threshold:</para>
              <para>(1)The threshold is normally located at the extremity of a runway if there are no obstacles penetrating above the approach surface. In some cases, however, due to local conditions it may be desirable to displace the threshold permanently (see below). When studying the location of a threshold, consideration should also be given to the height of the ILS reference datum, and/or MLS approach reference datum, and the determination of the obstacle clearance limits. Specifications concerning the height of the ILS reference datum and MLS approach reference datum are given in ICAO Annex 10, Volume I.</para>
              <para>(2)In determining that no obstacles penetrate above the approach surface, account should be taken of mobile objects (vehicles on roads, trains, etc.) at least within that portion of the approach area within 1&#160;200&#160;m longitudinally from the threshold and of an overall width of not less than 150&#160;m.</para>
              <para>(e)Displaced threshold:</para>
              <para>(1)If an object extends above the approach surface and the object cannot be removed, consideration should be given to displacing the threshold permanently.</para>
              <para>(2)To meet the obstacle limitation objectives of the certification specifications prescribed in Chapter H, the threshold should ideally be displaced down the runway for the distance necessary to provide that the approach surface is cleared of obstacles.</para>
              <para>(3)However, displacement of the threshold from the runway extremity should inevitably cause reduction of the landing distance available, and this may be of greater operational significance than penetration of the approach surface by marked and lighted obstacles. A decision to displace the threshold, and the extent of such displacement, should, therefore, have regard to an optimum balance between the considerations of clear approach surfaces and adequate landing distance. In deciding this question, account should need to be taken of the types of aeroplanes which the runway is intended to serve, the limiting visibility and cloud base conditions under which the runway should be used, the position of the obstacles in relation to the threshold and extended centre line, and, in the case of a precision approach runway, the significance of the obstacles to the determination of the obstacle clearance limit.</para>
              <para>(4)Notwithstanding the consideration of landing distance available, the selected position for the threshold should not be such that the obstacle-free surface to the threshold is steeper than 3.3&#160;% where the code number is 4 or steeper than 5&#160;% where the code number is 3.</para>
              <para>(5)In the event of a threshold being located according to the criteria for obstacle-free surfaces in the preceding paragraph, the obstacle marking requirements of Chapter Q should continue to be met in relation to the displaced threshold.</para>
              <para>(6)Depending on the length of the displacement, the RVR at the threshold could differ from that at the beginning of the runway for take-offs. The use of red runway edge lights with photometric intensities lower than the nominal value of 10&#160;000&#160;cd for white lights increases that phenomenon.</para>

              <para>ED Decision 2017/021/R</para>
              <para>(a)Runway shoulders should be so prepared as to be capable of supporting the aeroplanes using the runway without causing structural damage to those aeroplanes. They should also be capable of supporting vehicles such as firefighting appliances. In some cases, whilst the bearing strength of the natural ground may be sufficient, special preparation may be necessary to avoid erosion and the possible ingestion of debris by engines.</para>
              <para>(b)Guidance on characteristics and treatment of runway shoulders:</para>
              <para>(1)The shoulder of a runway or stopway should be prepared or constructed so as to support an aeroplane and minimise any hazard to an aeroplane running off the runway or stopway. Some guidance is given in the following paragraphs on certain special problems which may arise, and on further measures to avoid the ingestion of loose stones or other objects by turbine engines.</para>
              <para>(2)In some cases, the bearing strength of the natural ground in the strip may be sufficient, without special preparation, to meet the requirements for shoulders. Where special preparation is necessary, the method used should depend on local soil conditions and on the mass of the aeroplanes the runway is intended to serve. Soil tests should help in determining the best method of improvement (e.g. drainage, stabilisation, surfacing and light paving).</para>
              <para>(c)Attention should also be paid when designing shoulders to prevent the ingestion of stones or other objects by turbine engines. Similar considerations apply here to those discussed for the margins of taxiways both as to the special measures that may be necessary and as to the distance over which such special measures, if required, should be taken. Further guidance is given in ICAO Doc 9157, Aerodrome Design Manual, Part 1 Runways, and Part 2, Taxiways, Aprons and Holding Bays.</para>
              <para>(d)Where shoulders have been treated specially, either to provide the required bearing strength or to prevent the presence of stones or debris, difficulties may arise because of a lack of visual contrast between the runway surface and that of the adjacent strip. Such difficulties can be overcome either by providing a good visual contrast between the surfacing of the runway and of the strip, or by providing a runway side stripe marking.</para>
              <para>(e)Additional guidance on strength of runway shoulders is given in ICAO Doc 9157, Aerodrome Design Manual, Part 1, Runways.</para>

              <para>(c)If movements of 4-engined aircraft with a code letter D take place, the need for fully paved width shoulders should be assessed by local hazard analysis. Where the runway shoulder is not paved, it may be possible to contain the risk from erosion or from the ingestion of debris. In such cases:</para>
              <para>(1)The runway shoulder should be stabilised and the ground is prepared so that there is full grass coverage with no loose gravel or other material. This may include additional materials if the bearing strength and surface of the ground are not sufficient.</para>
              <para>(2)A programme of inspections of the shoulders and runway may be implemented to confirm their continuing serviceability, and ensure that there is no deterioration that could create a risk of foreign object debris (FOD), or otherwise hazard aircraft operations.</para>
              <para>(3)A programme of sweeping may be required before and after movements, should debris be drawn onto the runway surface.</para>

              <para>(a)Within the graded portion of the runway strip, measures should be taken to prevent an aeroplane&#8217;s wheel when sinking into the ground, from striking a hard vertical face. Special problems may arise for runway light fittings or other objects mounted in the strip or at the intersection with a taxiway or another runway. In the case of constructions within the graded portion of the runway strip, such as intersecting runways or taxiways, where the surface should also be flush with the strip surface, they should be delethalised, that is, so constructed as to avoid presenting a buried vertical face to aircraft wheels in soft ground conditions in any direction from which an aircraft is likely to approach. A vertical face can be eliminated by chamfering from the top of those constructions to not less than 30 cm below the strip surface level. Other objects situated within the graded portion of the runway strip, the functions of which do not require them to be at surface level, should be buried to a depth of not less than 30&#160;cm. Where this is not feasible, to eliminate a buried vertical surface, a slope should be provided which extends from the top of the construction to not less than 30 cm below ground level. The slope can be created by using a mixture of compacted gravel or asphalt or crushed aggregates and soil.</para>
              <para>(b)Consideration should be given to the location and design of drains on a runway strip to prevent damage to an aeroplane accidentally running off a runway. Suitably designed drain covers may be required.</para>
              <para>(c)Guidance on the design of drain covers is given in ICAO Doc 9157, Aerodrome Design Manual, Part 1, Runways.</para>
              <para>(d)Where open-air or covered storm water conveyances are installed, consideration should be given in order to ensure that their structure does not extend above the surrounding ground so as not to be considered an obstacle.</para>
              <para>(e)Particular attention needs to be given to the design and maintenance of an open-air storm water conveyance in order to prevent wildlife attraction, in particular birds. The open-air storm water conveyance may be covered by a net, if required. Further guidance is given in ICAO Doc&#160;9137, Airport Services Manual, Part 3, Wildlife Control and Reduction.</para>
              <para>(f)The term &#8216;aircraft safety purposes&#8217; refers to the installation of arresting systems.</para>

              <para>Since the graded portion of a strip is provided to minimise the hazard to an aircraft running off the runway, it should grant sufficient strength in such a manner as to prevent the collapse of the nose landing gear of the aircraft. The surface should be prepared in such a manner as to provide drag to an aircraft and below the surface, it should have sufficient bearing strength to avoid damage to the aircraft. To meet these divergent needs, the following guidelines are provided for preparing the strip. It is noted, that a depth of 15&#160;cm is a depth to which the nose gear may sink without collapsing. Therefore, it is recommended that the soil at a depth of 15&#160;cm below the finished strip surface should be prepared to have a sufficient stability, demonstrated by bearing strength of California Bearing Ratio (CBR) value of 15 to 20. The intention of this is to prevent the nose gear from damage. The top 15&#160;cm may be of lesser strength which would facilitate deceleration of aircraft. There are also other methods for soil investigation. In case of a deeper sinking than 15 cm, the maximum wheel sinking without collapsing should be examined by using different methods of soil investigation.</para>

              <para>ED Decision 2016/027/R</para>
              <para>(a)Rapid drainage of surface water is a primary safety consideration in the design, construction and maintenance of movement area and adjacent areas.</para>
              <para>(b)There are two distinct drainage processes:</para>
              <para>(1)natural drainage of the surface water from the top of the pavement surface until it reaches the final recipient such as rivers or other water bodies; and</para>
              <para>(2)dynamic drainage of the surface water trapped under a moving tire until it reaches outside the tire-to-ground contact area.</para>
              <para>Both drainage processes can be controlled through design, construction and maintenance of the pavements in order to prevent accumulation of water on the pavement surface.</para>
              <para>(c)Surface drainage is a basic requirement and serves to minimise water depth on the surface. Adequate surface drainage is provided primarily by an appropriately sloped surface (in both the longitudinal and transverse directions). The resulting combined longitudinal and transverse slope is the path for the drainage runoff. This path can be shortened by adding transverse grooves.</para>
              <para>(d)Dynamic drainage is achieved through built-in texture in the pavement surface. The rolling tire builds up water pressure and squeezes the water out the escape channels provided by the texture. The dynamic drainage of the tire-to-ground contact area may be improved by adding transverse grooves provided that they are subject to rigorous maintenance.</para>
              <para>(e)Through construction, the drainage characteristics of the surface are built into the pavement. These surface characteristics are:</para>
              <para>(1)Slopes;</para>
              <para>(2)Texture:</para>
              <para>(i)Microtexture;</para>
              <para>(ii)Macrotexture.</para>
              <para>(f)Slopes for the various parts of the movement area and adjacent parts are described in Chapters B to G and figures are given as per cent. Further guidance is given in ICAO Doc 9157, Aerodrome Design Manual, Part 1, Runways, Chapter 5.</para>
              <para>(g)Texture in the literature is described as microtexture or macrotexture. These terms are understood differently in various part of the aviation industry.</para>
              <para>(h)Microtexture is the texture of the individual stones and is hardly detectable by the eye. Microtexture is considered a primary component in skid resistance at slow speeds. On a wet surface at higher speeds a water film may prevent direct contact between the surface asperities and the tire due to insufficient drainage from the tire-to-ground contact area. Microtexture is a built-in quality of the pavement surface. By specifying crushed material that will withstand polishing microtexture, drainage of thin water films are ensured for a longer period of time. Resistance against polishing is expressed in terms of the polished stone values (PSV) which is in principle a value obtained from a friction measurement in accordance with international standards. These standards define the PSV minima that will enable a material with a good microtexture to be selected. A major problem with microtexture is that it can change within short time periods without being easily detected. A typical example of this is the accumulation of rubber deposits in the touchdown area which will largely mask microtexture without necessarily reducing macrotexture.</para>
              <para>(k)Macrotexture is the texture among the individual stones. This scale of texture may be judged approximately by the eye. Macrotexture is primarily created by the size of aggregate used or by surface treatment of the pavement and is the major factor influencing drainage capacity at high speeds. Materials should be selected so as to achieve good macrotexture.</para>
              <para>(l)The primary purpose of grooving a runway surface is to enhance surface drainage. Natural drainage can be slowed down by surface texture, but grooving can speed up the drainage by providing a shorter drainage path and increasing the drainage rate.</para>
              <para>(m)For measurement of macrotexture, simple methods such as the &#8216;sand and grease patch&#8217; methods described in ICAO Doc 9137, Airport Services Manual, Part 2, Pavement Surface Conditions were developed. These methods were used for the early research on which current airworthiness requirements are based and which refer to a classification categorising macrotexture from A to E. This classification was developed, using sand or grease patch measuring techniques, and issued in 1971 by the Engineering Sciences Data Unit (ESDU).</para>
              <para>(n)Using this classification, the threshold value between microtexture and macrotexture is 0.1&#160;mm mean texture depth (MTD). Related to this scale, the normal wet runway aircraft performance is based upon texture giving drainage and friction qualities midway between classification B and C (0.25&#160;mm). Improved drainage through better texture might qualify for a better aircraft performance class. However, such credit must be in accordance with aeroplane manufacturers&#8217; documentation. Presently credit is given to grooved or porous friction course runways following design, construction and maintenance criteria. The harmonised certification standards of some States refer to texture giving drainage and friction qualities midway between classification D and E (1.0&#160;mm).</para>
              <para>(o)For construction, design and maintenance, various international standards are used. Currently ISO 13473-1: &#8216;Characterization of pavement texture by use of surface profiles &#8212; Part 1: Determination of Mean Profile Depth&#8217; links the volumetric measuring technique with non-contact profile measuring techniques giving comparable texture values. These standards describe the threshold value between microtexture and macrotexture as 0.5&#160;mm. The volumetric method has a validity range from 0.25 to 5 mm MTD. The profilometry method has a validity range from 0 to 5 mm mean profile depth (MPD). The values of MPD and MTD differ due to the finite size of the glass spheres used in the volumetric technique and because the MPD is derived from a two-dimensional profile rather than a three-dimensional surface. Therefore, a transformation equation must be established for the measuring equipment used to relate MPD to MTD.</para>
              <para>(p)The ESDU scale groups runway surfaces based on macrotexture from A through E, where E represents the surface with best dynamic drainage capacity. The ESDU scale thus reflects the dynamic drainage characteristics of the pavement. Grooving any of these surfaces enhances the dynamic drainage capacity. The resulting drainage capacity of the surface is thus a function of the texture (A through E) and grooving. The contribution from grooving is a function of the size of the grooves and the spacing between the grooves. Aerodromes exposed to heavy or torrential rainfall must ensure that the pavement and adjacent areas have drainage capability to withstand these rainfalls or put limitations on the use of the pavements under such extreme situations. These airports should seek to have the maximum allowable slopes and the use of aggregates providing good drainage characteristics. They should also consider grooved pavements in the E classification to ensure that safety is not impaired.</para>

              <para>GM1 ADR-DSN.B.195&#160;Clearways</para>
              <para>ED Decision 2014/013/R</para>
              <para>(a)Because of transverse or longitudinal slopes on a runway, shoulder, or strip, in certain cases, the lower limit of the clearway plane specified above may be below the corresponding elevation of the runway, shoulder, or strip. It is not intended that these surfaces be graded to conform with the lower limit of the clearway plane, nor is it intended that terrain or objects which are above the clearway plane beyond the end of the strip, but below the level of the strip be removed unless it is considered that they may endanger aeroplanes.</para>
              <para>(b)Abrupt upward changes in slope should be avoided when the slope on the ground in a clearway is relatively small or when the mean slope is upward. In such situations, in that portion of the clearway within a distance of 22.5&#160;m or half the runway width whichever is greater, on each side of the extended centre line, the slopes, slope changes, and the transition from runway to clearway should generally conform with those of the runway with which the clearway is associated.</para>
              <para>(c)The decision to provide a stopway and/or a clearway as an alternative to an increased length of runway should depend on the physical characteristics of the area beyond the runway end, and on the operating performance requirements of the prospective aeroplanes. The runway, stopway, and clearway lengths to be provided are determined by the aeroplane take-off performance but a check should also be made of the landing distance required by the aeroplanes using the runway to ensure that adequate runway length is provided for landing. The length of a clearway, however, cannot exceed half the length of take-off run available.</para>
              <para>(d)The aeroplane performance operating limitations require a length which is enough to ensure that the aeroplane can, after starting a take-off, either be brought safely to a stop or complete the take-off safely. For the purpose of discussion, it is supposed that the runway, stopway and clearway lengths provided at the aerodrome are only just adequate for the aeroplane requiring the longest take-off and accelerate-stop distances, taking into account its take-off mass, runway characteristics, and ambient atmospheric conditions. Under these circumstances there is, for each take-off, a speed, called the decision speed; below this speed, the take-off should be abandoned if an engine fails while above it the take-off should be completed. A very long take-off run and take-off distance would be required to complete a take-off when an engine fails before the decision speed is reached because of the insufficient speed and the reduced power available. There would be no difficulty in stopping in the remaining accelerate-stop distance available provided action is taken immediately. In these circumstances the correct course of action would be to abandon the take-off.</para>
              <para>(e)On the other hand if an engine fails after the decision speed is reached, the aeroplane should have sufficient speed and power available to complete the take-off safely in the remaining take-off distance available. However, because of the high speed, there would be difficulty in stopping the aeroplane in the remaining accelerate-stop distance available.</para>
              <para>(f)The decision speed is not a fixed speed for any aeroplane but can be selected by the pilot within limits to suit the accelerate-stop and take-off distance available, aeroplane take-off mass, runway characteristics, and ambient atmospheric conditions at the aerodrome. Normally, a higher decision speed is selected as the accelerate-stop distance available increases.</para>
              <para>(g)A variety of combinations of accelerate-stop distances required and take-off distances required can be obtained to accommodate a particular aeroplane, taking into account the aeroplane take-off mass, runway characteristics, and ambient atmospheric conditions. Each combination requires its particular length of take-off run.</para>
              <para>(h)The most familiar case is where the decision speed is such that the take-off distance required is equal to the accelerate-stop distance required; this value is known as the balanced field length. Where stopway and clearway are not provided, these distances are both equal to the runway length. However, if landing distance is for the moment ignored, runway is not essential for the whole of the balanced field length, as the take-off run required is, of course, less than the balanced field length. The balanced field length can, therefore, be provided by a runway supplemented by an equal length of clearway and stopway, instead of wholly as a runway. If the runway is used for take-off in both directions, an equal length of clearway and stopway has to be provided at each runway end. The saving in runway length is, therefore, bought at the cost of a greater overall length.</para>
              <para>(i)In case economic considerations preclude the provision of stopway and, as a result, only runway and clearway are to be provided, the runway length (neglecting landing requirements) should be equal to the accelerate-stop distance required or the take-off run required whichever is greater. The take-off distance available should be the length of the runway plus the length of clearway.</para>
              <para>(j)The minimum runway length and the maximum stopway or clearway length to be provided may be determined as follows, from the data in the aeroplane flight manual for the aeroplane considered to be critical from the viewpoint of runway length requirements:</para>
              <para>(1)If a stopway is economically possible, the lengths to be provided are those for the balanced field length. The runway length is the take-off run required or the landing distance required whichever is greater. If the accelerate-stop distance required is greater than the runway length so determined, the excess may be provided as stopway, usually at each end of the runway. In addition, a clearway of the same length as the stopway should also be provided;</para>
              <para>(2)If a stopway is not to be provided, the runway length is the landing distance required, or if it is greater, the accelerate-stop distance required, which corresponds to the lowest practical value of the decision speed. The excess of the take-off distance required over the runway length may be provided as clearway, usually at each end of the runway.</para>
              <para>(k)In addition to the above consideration, the concept of clearways in certain circumstances can be applied to a situation where the take-off distance required for all engines operating exceeds that required for the engine failure case.</para>

              <para>(a)In order to accommodate aeroplanes making auto-coupled approaches and automatic landings (irrespective of weather conditions), it is desirable that slope changes be avoided or kept to a minimum, on a rectangular area at least 300&#160;m long before the threshold of a precision approach runway. The area should be symmetrical about the extended centre line, 120&#160;m wide. When special circumstances so warrant, the width may be reduced to no less than 60&#160;m if a safety assessment indicates that such reduction would not affect the safety of operations of aircraft. This is desirable because these aeroplanes are equipped with a radio altimeter for final height and flare guidance, and when the aeroplane is above the terrain immediately prior to the threshold, the radio altimeter should begin to provide information to the automatic pilot for auto-flare. Where slope changes cannot be avoided, the rate of change between two consecutive slopes should not exceed 2&#160;% per 30&#160;m.</para>
              <para>(b)With a radio altimeter operating area in the pre-threshold area of a precision approach runway the margin to calculate the decision altitude should be smaller and the usability of the adjacent runway may be enhanced.</para>

              <para>(a)General</para>
              <para>(1)A runway end safety area should provide an area long and wide enough, and suitable to contain overruns and undershoots resulting from a reasonably probable combination of adverse operational factors. On a precision approach runway, the ILS localiser is normally the first upstanding obstacle, and the runway end safety area should extend up to this facility. In other circumstances, the first upstanding obstacle may be a road, a railroad, or other constructed or natural feature. The provisions of a runway end safety area should take such obstacle into consideration.</para>
              <para>(2)Whatever length of RESA is provided, it is important to ensure that likelihood of, and potential impacts arising from an overrun are minimised as far as reasonably practicable.</para>
              <para>(3)It is recognised that achieving the recommended distance could present challenges. Therefore, the aim of this guidance is to identify the types of aerodrome activities that can be undertaken to reduce the likelihood and consequences of an overrun occurring, and to decide on appropriate actions and it is suggested that aerodrome operators assess their RESA provisions.</para>
              <para>(4)The overrun is a complex risk to assess because there are a number of variables, such as prevailing weather, type of aeroplane, the landing aids available, runway characteristics and available distances, the surrounding environment, and human factors. Each of these can have a significant contribution to the overall hazard; furthermore, the nature of the hazard and level of risk should be different for each aerodrome and even for each runway direction at any one aerodrome. The aerodrome may address some, and these are included below. Additionally, aircraft operating procedures may impact but the aerodrome may have little ability to influence these. This should not prevent aerodromes from working with aircraft operators so that the operations are conducted so as to minimise the likelihood of an overrun occurring.</para>
              <para>(5)Noting the requirement for a runway end safety area (RESA) consideration should be given to providing an area long enough to contain overruns and undershoots resulting from a reasonably probable combination of adverse operational factors. Therefore, aerodromes should try to maximise the length of RESA available on all applicable runways. When considering the RESA distance required for individual circumstances, aerodromes operators should take into account factors, such as:</para>
              <para>(i)the runway length and slope, in particular the general operating lengths required for take-off and landing versus the runway distances available, including the excess of available length over that required;</para>
              <para>(ii)current RESA provision (length &amp; width &#8211; how much the RESA complies with the recommended distance) and options to increase or improve this;</para>
              <para>(iii)the nature and location of any hazard beyond the runway end, including the topography and obstruction environment in and beyond the RESA and outside the runway strip;</para>
              <para>(iv)the type of aeroplane and level of traffic at the aerodrome, and actual or proposed changes to either;</para>
              <para>(v)aircraft performance limitations arising from runway and RESA length &#8211; high performance aircraft, operating at high loads and speeds have greater length requirements than smaller, low-performance aircraft, the relationship between required balanced field length and available distances;</para>
              <para>(vi)navigation aids available (PBN, instrument or visual - if an ILS is only available on one runway direction, a downwind approach and landing may be necessary in poor weather) and the availability of vertical guidance ;</para>
              <para>(vii)friction and drainage characteristics of the runway, which impact on runway susceptibility to surface contamination and aeroplane braking action;</para>
              <para>(viii)traffic density, which may lead to increased pressure to vacate so increased speed;</para>
              <para>(ix)aerodrome weather patterns, including wind shear;</para>
              <para>(x)aerodrome overrun history; and</para>
              <para>(xi)overrun/undershoot causal factors.</para>
              <para>(b)Assessment of runway end safety areas</para>
              <para>(1)The RESA assessment should help the aerodrome operator identify the hazards and appropriate actions to reduce the risk. A range of measures may be available, singly or in combination, to reduce the risks of an overrun occurring or becoming an accident. Measures aimed at reducing the likelihood of an overrun/undershoot include:</para>
              <para>(i)improving runway surfaces and friction measurement, particularly when the runway is contaminated &#8212; know your runways and their condition and characteristics in precipitation;</para>
              <para>(ii)ensuring that accurate and up-to-date information on weather, the runway state and characteristics, is notified and passed to flight crews in a timely way, particularly when flight crews need to make operational adjustments;</para>
              <para>(iii)improving an aerodrome management&#8217;s knowledge, recording, prediction and dissemination of wind data, including wind shear, and any other relevant weather information, particularly when it is a significant feature of an aerodrome&#8217;s weather pattern;</para>
              <para>(iv)upgrading visual and instrument landing aids to improve the accuracy of aeroplane delivery at the correct landing position on runways (including the provision of Instrument Landing PBN approach systems, location of aiming point and harmonisation with PAPIs);</para>
              <para>(v)formulating, in consultation with aeroplane operators, adverse weather and any other relevant aerodrome operating procedures or restrictions, and promulgating such information appropriately; and</para>
              <para>(vi)working with aircraft operators to optimise the operation.</para>
              <para>(2)Combined with this, measures may be considered that would reduce the severity of the consequences should an event occur. Wherever practicable, aerodrome operators should seek to optimise the RESA. This may be achieved through a combination of:</para>
              <para>(i)relocation, shifting or realignment of the runway &#8212; it may be possible to construct additional pavement at the start of take-off end to make more pavement available to retain the declared distances. The start and end of declared distances can be moved towards the downwind (start of take-off) end, thereby retaining the declared distance and creating space for a longer RESA, as shown in GM1&#160;ADR-DSN.B.035;</para>
              <para>(ii)in the case where undershoot RESA is limited and the runway has a displaced landing threshold, examine whether the threshold can be moved (downwind) to increase the RESA and/or runway length;</para>
              <para>(iii)reducing runway declared distances in order to provide the necessary RESA may be a viable option where the existing runway length exceeds that required for the existing or projected design aircraft. If the take-off distance required for the critical aircraft operating at the aerodrome is less than the take-off distance available, there may be an opportunity to reduce the relevant runway declared distances. Where provision of a runway end safety area would be particularly prohibitive to implement consideration would have to be given to reducing some of the declared distances of the runway for the provision of a runway end safety area and/or installation of an arresting system;</para>
              <para>(iv)increasing the length of a RESA, and/or minimising the obstruction environment in the area beyond the RESA. Means to increase the RESA provision include land acquisition, improvements to the grading, realigning fences or roads to provide additional area;</para>
              <para>(v)installing an arresting systemaccording to CS&#160;ADR-DSN.C.236 (EMAS), or another suitably positioned and designed type of an arresting system, to supplement or as an alternative to a RESA where an equivalent level of safety is demonstrated;</para>
              <para>(vi)improving the slopes in the RESA to minimise or remove downward slopes; and</para>
              <para>(vii)providing paved RESA with known friction characteristics.</para>
              <para>(3)A runway meant for take-off and landing in both directions should have 2 RESAs extending for the required distance beyond the end of the strip extending from the runway end. Depending of the position of the threshold on a runway, the RESA related to the reverse runway should protect aircraft undershooting the threshold. Assessments of overruns and undershoots have shown that the likelihood of an undershoot is approximately four times less than for an overrun. Additionally, the undershoot rate shows that the likelihood of an event is further reduced by the availability of precision approach aids, especially those with vertical guidance. Therefore, on a precision approach runway consideration may include whether to reduce the minimum length of RESA towards the length of the runway strip before the runway.</para>
              <para>(4)It is recognised that improving RESAs is often difficult. However, it is important to note that incremental gains should be obtained wherever possible, as any gain is valuable. Therefore, whenever a runway project involves construction, consideration should also be given to improving the RESA.</para>
              <para>(5)The above lists are not in any particular order, are not exhaustive, and should complement action by aeroplane operators, designers and aviation regulators.</para>
              <para>(6)RESA provision should be considered by the Local Runway Safety Team.</para>
              <para>(c)Arresting systems on runway end safety areas</para>
              <para>(1)Arresting systems can be predictable and effective in arresting aeroplane overruns.</para>
              <para>(2)Arresting system designs should be supported by a validated design method that can predict the performance of the system. The design method should be derived from field or laboratory tests. Testing may be based either on passage of an actual aircraft or an equivalent single wheel load through a test bed. The design should consider multiple aircraft parameters, including but not limited to allowable aircraft gear loads, gear configuration, tire contact pressure, aircraft centre of gravity, and aircraft speed. The model should calculate imposed aircraft gear loads, g-forces on aircraft occupants, deceleration rates, and stopping distances within the arresting system.</para>
              <para>(3)Demonstrated performance of an arresting system can be achieved by a validated design method which can predict the performance of the system. The design and performance should be based on the type of aeroplane anticipated to use the associated runway that imposes the greatest demand upon the arresting system. The design of an arresting system should be based on a critical (or design) aircraft which is defined as aircraft using the associated runway that imposes the greatest demand upon the arresting system. This is usually but not always, the heaviest/largest aircraft that regularly uses the runway. Arresting system performance is dependent not only on aircraft weight but allowable aeroplane gear loads, gear configuration, tire contact pressure, aeroplane centre of gravity and aeroplane speed. Accommodating undershoots should also be addressed. All configurations should be considered in optimising the arresting system design. The aerodrome operator and arresting system manufacturer should consult regarding the selection of the design aeroplane that should optimise the arresting system for a particular aerodrome. Additionally, the design should allow the safe operation of fully loaded rescue and fire fighting vehicles, including their ingress and egress.</para>

            <para>(e)Arresting performance:</para>
            <para>(1)An EMAS should be designed to decelerate the design aircraft at an exit speed of 70 knots at both maximum take-off weight (MTOW) and 80 % maximum landing weight (MLW) without imposing loads that exceed the aircraft&#8217;s design limits, causing major structural damage to the aircraft or imposing excessive forces on its occupants.</para>

              <para>GM1&#160;ADR-DSN.C.236 Engineered Materials Arresting System (EMAS)</para>
              <para>(a)Engineered materials:</para>
              <para>(1)The materials are tailored to specific mechanical properties and are referred to as engineered materials.</para>
              <para>(2)The engineered materials have to meet a force-deformation profile within limits which have been shown to assure uniform characteristics, and therefore, predictable response to an aircraft entering the EMAS.</para>
              <para>(3)The engineered materials will crush under the landing gears of the aeroplane when it engages the EMAS. The crushing is an irreversible or partly irreversible process and the arresting performance of the system is proportional to the amount of energy that is dissipated.</para>
              <para>(b)The compatibility of the EMAS with the specific meteorological and aerodrome conditions is ensured by using materials which:</para>
              <para>(1)are water-resistant to the extent that the presence of water does not affect system performance;</para>

              <para>(4)exhibit constant strength and density characteristics during all climatic conditions within a temperature range that is appropriate for the local conditions;</para>

              <para>(c)Undershoot:</para>
              <para>(1)An EMAS is not intended to reduce the risk of damage to an aeroplane undershooting the runway. However, the presence of an EMAS cannot increase the potential for damage in case of undershoot more than the risk that is associated with an undershoot in a RESA.</para>
              <para>(2)Compliance with CS&#160;ADR-DSN.C.236&#160;(c)(11) could be justified through experience of real cases of undershoot in an EMAS, flight simulator tests, other type of studies, or a combination of the three.</para>
              <para>(d)An EMAS is a passive system which does not require any specific action or procedures by the flight crew. However, a basic knowledge of the systems by the crew is considered advantageous to prevent undesired evasive manoeuvres that could cause the aircraft to avoid entering the bed or system. The EMAS is designed to be entered preferably straight ahead with the unrestricted use of wheel brakes and/or thrust reversers. Additionally, the availability of an EMAS cannot be used for flight planning purposes, i.e., it cannot be included in the declared distances.</para>
              <para>(e)Mechanical property:</para>
              <para>(1)An EMAS is not intended to support vehicular traffic for maintenance or normal operating purposes.</para>
              <para>(2)The EMAS needs to be capable of supporting personnel walking on it for the purposes of its own maintenance and co-located air navigation aids without causing any damage to its surface.</para>
              <para>(3)Precaution needs to be taken during snow and ice removal to prevent damage to the EMAS bed.</para>
              <para>(4)Light equipment for snow removal may be used in accordance with the manufacturer&#180;s specification to avoid any damage to the surface.</para>
              <para>(f)Setback distance:</para>
              <para>(1)The setback distance is defined as the distance between the runway end or stopway, if provided, and the beginning of the EMAS.</para>
              <para>(2)The setback distance will vary depending on the available area and the EMAS design.</para>
              <para>(3)The calculation of the setback distance balances the risk objectives of:</para>
              <para>(i)providing enough area for arresting purposes;</para>
              <para>(ii)providing enough separation to protect the bed from jet blast;</para>
              <para>(iii)providing separation from the threshold to reduce the probability of undershoot in the EMAS; and</para>
              <para>(iv)decreasing the probability of aircraft overruns passing by one side of the EMAS due to lateral dispersion.</para>
              <para>The safety assessment determines the relevance of each risk objective, taking into account the operating particularities of the associated runway, including usage of the runway, types of approach, weather conditions, fleet, incidents and accidents, and any other particularity related with runway safety.</para>
              <para>(4)To reduce the probability of an aircraft undershooting in an EMAS, it is recommended to provide a minimum setback distance of at least 60 m from the threshold or runway end. However, this separation may be reduced if a safety assessment determines that it is the best alternative for both overrun and undershoot protection.</para>
              <para>(g)An EMAS normally includes steps and/or slopes at its end and both sides, but they are not considered functional for arresting purposes. Where possible, the functional width of the EMAS is to be maintained the same throughout the whole length of the system.</para>
              <para>(h)Exit speed is defined as the speed of the nose gear of the aeroplane as it passes the runway end or stopway, if provided.</para>
              <para>(i)The critical aircraft is defined as the aircraft that regularly uses the associated runway that imposes the greatest demand upon the EMAS.</para>
              <para>(j)Design aircraft list refers to the combination of aircraft types which are/will be operating regularly on the runway.</para>
              <para>The critical aircraft is usually, but not always, the heaviest/largest aircraft that regularly uses the runway. The performance of an EMAS is dependent not only on aeroplane weight, but also on the landing gear configuration, tyre pressure, and centre of gravity. In general, the operational maximum take-off weight (operational MTOW) is used for the critical aircraft. However, there may be instances where less than the MTOW will require a longer EMAS. All parameters are to be considered in optimising the EMAS design. However, to the extent practicable, the EMAS design may consider both the aeroplane that imposes the greatest demand upon the EMAS and the range of aircraft expected to operate regularly on the runway. In some instances, a composite of design aircraft may be preferable to optimising the EMAS for a specific runway than a single critical aircraft. Other factors that are unique to a particular aerodrome, such as available RESA and air cargo operations, should also be considered in the final design.</para>
              <para>(k)Testing:</para>
              <para>Testing is to be based either on passage of an actual aircraft, or a single wheel bearing an equivalent load through a test bed. The design will need to consider multiple aircraft parameters, including but not limited to allowable aircraft gear loads, gear configuration, tyre contact pressure, weight, centre of gravity, and speed.</para>

              <para>GM1&#160;ADR-DSN.D.240&#160;Taxiways general</para>
              <para>(a)Taxiways should be provided to permit the safe and expeditious surface movement of aircraft. Sufficient entrance and exit taxiways for a runway should be provided to expedite the movement of aeroplanes to and from the runway and provision of rapid exit taxiways considered when traffic volumes are high.</para>
              <para>(b)Design of runway and taxiway infrastructure that either prevents aircraft entering or crossing a runway or mitigates the risk of an aircraft runway incursion collision should be considered both in the development of any new infrastructure and as a retrospective enhancement to existing infrastructure especially in hot-spot areas (areas where risk appraisal or incident data demonstrates a higher risk). This guidance may be considered as part of a runway incursion prevention programme and to help ensure that runway incursion aspects are addressed in any new design proposal.</para>
              <para>(c)The initial approach should be to reduce the number of available entrances to the runway, so that the potential for entry to the runway at an unintended location is minimised. Taxiway entry, crossing and runway exit taxiways should be clearly identified and promulgated, using taxiing guidance signs, lighting and pavement markings.</para>
              <para>(d)Many aerodromes have more than one runway, notably paired parallel runways (two runways on one side of the terminal apron), which create a difficult problem in that either on arrival or departure an aircraft is required to cross a runway. The potential for runway crossings should be eliminated or at least be as low as reasonably practicable. This may be achieved by constructing a &#8216;perimeter taxiway&#8217; to enable aircraft to get to the departure runway or to the apron without either crossing a runway, or conflicting with an approaching or departing aircraft.</para>
              <para>(e)A perimeter taxiway is ideally designed according to the following criteria:</para>
              <para>(1)Sufficient space is required between the landing threshold and the taxiway centre line where it crosses under the approach path, to enable the critical aeroplane to pass under the approach without violating the approach surface.</para>
              <para>(2)The extent of the jet blast impact of aircraft taking off is considered when determining the location of a perimeter taxiway.</para>
              <para>(3)The requirement for RESA, as well as possible interference with the ILS or other navigation aids is also taken into account: the perimeter taxiway is located behind the localiser antenna, not between the localiser antenna and the runway, due to the potential for severe ILS disturbance, noting that this is harder to achieve as the distance between the localiser and the runway increases. Likewise, perimeter roads are provided where possible.</para>
              <para>(4)Appropriate measures should be considered in order to assist pilots to distinguish between aircraft that are crossing the runway and those that are safely on a perimeter taxiway.</para>
              <para>(f)Taxiways crossing runways should be provided at low energy locations, preferably at the runway ends. Where runway crossings cannot be eliminated, they should only be done on taxiways at right angles to a runway. This will afford the flight crew an unobstructed view of the runway, in both directions, to confirm that the runway and approach is clear of conflicting traffic before proceeding across.</para>
              <para>(g)The runway/taxiway junction configuration should be simple, for example with single taxiway entrances; this is particularly relevant for taxiways crossing runways.</para>
              <para>(h)The main design principles for entry and exit taxiways are:</para>
              <para>(1)Taxiways should be perpendicular to the runway centre line if possible.</para>
              <para>(2)The taxiway angle should be such that the crew of an aircraft at a taxiway holding position (if any) should be able to see an aircraft using or approaching the runway. Where the taxiway angle is such that this clear view, in both directions is not possible, consideration is given to provide a perpendicular portion of the taxiway immediately adjacent to the runway to allow for a full visual scan prior to entering (or crossing).</para>
              <para>(3)Rapid exit taxiways are designed to be runway exits. Whilst it may be an operational practice at some airports to allow smaller aircraft the option of departing at a mid-point on the runway from one of these rapid exit taxiways, the geometry of the taxiway/runway intersection does not allow the crew to properly scan the runway in both directions to confirm that there is no conflicting traffic. This practice should thus be eliminated and from the design point of view, all signage and markings should deter any aircraft from using these rapid exit taxiways for any purpose other than what they are designed for (exiting the runway after landing). However, this may be mitigated by the addition of a fillet so that aircraft can manoeuvre to see down the approach. Note that aircraft on an angled taxiway may have a greater likelihood of causing ILS interference.</para>
              <para>(4)A clear separation of pavement between a rapid exit taxiway and other non-rapid taxiways entering or crossing a runway should be provided. This design principle prevents two taxiways from overlapping with each other and creating an excessive paved area that would confuse pilots entering a runway.</para>
              <para>(5)Limiting the options available to pilots on each entrance or exit helps to avoid confusion. Therefore, avoid dual or multiple taxiway entrances at one location, as Y-shaped connectors present opportunities for runway incursions and for aircraft vacating the runway to enter the wrong taxiway. Limiting the options available to pilots on each entrance or exit helps to avoid confusion.</para>
              <para>(6)Runway/taxiway separations should be sufficient to permit space for effective RETs.</para>
              <para>(7)Avoid designs which include crossing a runway to access a taxiway.</para>
              <para>(8)Provide clear separation between high speed (RET) and taxi speed runway exits; if RETs are provided have a series in a row without other entrances.</para>
              <para>(9)Where the aerodrome has more than one runway, ensure that runway ends are not too close together; if this is not possible ensure that they are clearly identified as separated. This may be achieved through visual aids, taxiway design and the taxiway naming convention.</para>
              <para>(10)Surface colour should not create confusion:</para>
              <para>(i)Have different colours for runway and taxiways.</para>
              <para>(ii)Avoid a mix of concrete &amp; asphalt.</para>
              <para>(11)Wide taxiway entrances onto runways should be broken up with islands or barriers or painting taxiway edges with continuous edge markings to indicate unusable pavement. Avoid long holding position lines and excess paved areas which reduce the effectiveness of signs and markings. Use standard taxiway widths, suitable for a wide range of aeroplane, including the largest type expected to use the aerodrome.</para>
              <para>(12)Avoid multi-taxiway intersections and reduce the number of taxiways at any intersection as far as possible.</para>
              <para>(13)As far as practicable, it is preferable to redesign rather than reconfigure or repaint where possible &#8211; design errors out and reduce potential for human error.</para>
              <para>(14)Consistent design of runway entrances &#8211; same visual aids at each, both taxiways and service road accesses.</para>
              <para>(15)It is always preferable for safety reasons to have a taxiway parallel to the runway all along the runway, even if capacity constraints do not make it necessary.</para>
              <para>(i)Aerodrome infrastructure can also be used to support design, whether by the systems installed or by their operating characteristics. Examples include:</para>
              <para>(1)Stopbars and runway guard lights should be provided at all entrances, and preferably illuminated H24 and in all weather conditions. Runway incursions do not happen only under restricted visibilities. In fact, more incursions happen when the weather is good.</para>
              <para>(2)Avoid confusion between CAT I and CAT III holding positions. This may be achieved in some circumstances by combining both holding positions.</para>
              <para>(j)Multi-taxiway entrances to a runway should be parallel to each other and should be distinctly separated by an unpaved area. This design principle allows each runway holding location an earthen area for the proper placement of accompanying sign, marking, and lighting visual cues at each runway holding position. Moreover, the design principle eliminates the construction of unusable pavement and as well as the painting of taxiway edge markings to indicate such unusable pavement. In general, excess paved areas at runway holding positions reduce the effectiveness of sign, marking, and lighting visual cues.</para>
              <para>(k)CS&#160;ADR-DSN.N.785 provides the certification specifications for a standardised scheme for the nomenclature of taxiways to improve situational awareness and as a part of an effective runway incursion prevention measure.</para>
              <para>(l)Additional guidance on layout and standardised nomenclature of taxiways is given in ICAO Doc&#160;9157, Aerodrome Design Manual, Part 2, Taxiways, Aprons and Holding Bays.</para>

              <para>(a)At low levels of aerodrome activity (less than approximately 50&#160;000 annual operations), there is normally little need to make deviations in the departure sequence. However, for higher activity levels, aerodromes with single taxiways and no holding bays or other bypasses provide aerodrome control units with no opportunity to change the sequence of departures once the aircraft have left the apron. In particular, at aerodromes with large apron areas, it is often difficult to arrange for aircraft to leave the apron in such a way that they should arrive at the end of the runway in the sequence required by air traffic services units.</para>
              <para>(b)The provision of an adequate number of holding bay spaces or other bypasses, based upon an analysis of the current and near-term hourly aircraft departure demand, should allow a large degree of flexibility in generating the departure sequence.</para>
              <para>(c)The space required for a holding bay depends on the number of aircraft positions to be provided, the size of the aircraft to be accommodated, and the frequency of their utilisation. The dimensions should allow for sufficient space between aircraft to enable them to manoeuvre independently.</para>
              <para>(d)Emergency access roads are not intended for use for the functions of aerodrome service roads. However, they should be provided by different access controls which should be clearly visible for all service ground traffic.</para>

              <para>(a)Care should be taken so that propeller wash and jet blast from holding aircraft do not interfere with aircraft operations, cause damage to vehicles, or injure people.</para>
              <para>(b)Generally, when used to allow flexible departure sequencing, the most advantageous location for a holding bay is adjacent to the taxiway serving the runway end. Other locations along the taxiway are satisfactory for aircraft performing pre-flight checks or engine run-ups, or as a holding point for aircraft awaiting departure clearance.</para>
              <para>(c)An aircraft taxiing could endanger aircraft operations when the aircraft is too close to the runway during take-off and landings. It is so advised to check if the aircraft taking off or landing could be hinder. For this OLS and specially approach surfaces, take-off climb surfaces and OFZ are the first aspects to consider. An aircraft taxiing could also endanger aircraft operations when the aircraft location and orientation are so that the aircraft interfere with navigation aids. It is specific to instrument runways and especially important for precision approach runways. The non-penetration of critical/sensitive areas is the first check. The areas within which this degradable interference of course or path signals are possible need to be defined and recognised. For the purposes of developing protective zoning criteria for ILS, these areas are critical areas and sensitive areas. The ILS critical area is an area of defined dimensions about the localizer and glide path antennas where vehicles, including aircraft, are excluded during all ILS operations. The critical area is protected, since the presence of vehicles and/or aircraft inside the critical area boundaries would cause unacceptable disturbance to the ILS signal. The ILS sensitive area is an area extending beyond the critical area where the parking and/or movement of vehicles, including aircraft, is controlled to prevent the possibility of unacceptable interference to the ILS signal during ILS operations.</para>
              <para>(d)For all runways, it should be verified that the distance between a holding bay, runway-holding position established at a taxiway/runway intersection or road-holding position and the centre line of a runway is so that a holding aircraft or vehicle should not infringe the approach surface and/or take-off climb surface.</para>
              <para>(e)If the affected runway is used under precision approach procedures, it should be also verified that the distance between a holding bay, runway-holding position established at a taxiway/runway intersection or road-holding position and the centre line of a runway is so that a holding aircraft or vehicle should not infringe the obstacle-free zone and the critical/sensitive areas of precision approach navigation aids (e.g. ILS/MLS).</para>
              <para>(f)If a holding bay, runway-holding position or road-holding position for a precision approach runway code number 4 is at a greater elevation compared to the threshold, the distance specified in Table D-2 could be further increased 5&#160;m for every metre the bay or position is higher than the threshold.</para>
              <para>(g)An aircraft taxiing could also endanger aircraft operation when the aircraft is too close to other taxiing aircraft. For this, separation distances or margins between taxiing aircraft or taxiways should be considered.</para>
              <para>(h)In radiotelephony phraseologies, the expression &#8216;holding point&#8217; is used to designate the runway-holding position.</para>

              <para>(1)a surface protection consisting in an overlay with a material inert against fuel; or</para>
              <para>(2)a product incorporated in the mass of the bituminous concrete during its fabrication, protecting aggregates and binder.</para>
              <para>(c)The first solution has the disadvantages to be fragile against stamping effects due to aircraft at the stand but is very useful for existing pavement protection.</para>
              <para>(d)Taking into account the stamping due to aircraft at stands and the weakness of bituminous concrete against fuel, the aircraft stand pavements are often in cement concrete, which offers a much better resistance to stamping and to fuel. Nevertheless, joints between cement concrete slabs could be also damaged by fuel. According to the location of such joints regarding aircraft location and refuelling devices location, it is preferable to manufacture such joints in a material resistant to the fuel.</para>
              <para>(e)The method for reporting the bearing strength of the pavement is available in Part-ADR.OPS of Regulation (EU) No&#160;139/2014.</para>
              <para>(f)Additional information on the bearing strength, the design and evaluation of pavements is given in ICAO Doc 9157, Aerodrome Design Manual, Part 3, Pavements.</para>

              <para>(a)The design of slopes should direct spilled fuel away from building and apron service areas. Where such slopes are unavoidable, special measures should be taken to reduce the fire hazard resulting from fuel spillage.</para>
              <para>(b)Slopes on apron have the same purpose as other pavement slopes, meaning to prevent the accumulation of water (or possible fluid contaminant) on the surface and to facilitate rapid drainage of surface water (or possible fluid contaminant). Nevertheless, the design of the apron, especially for the parts containing aircraft stands, should specifically take into account the impact of the slopes on the aircraft during its braking at the stand and during its start for departure (with push-back or with its own engines). The aims are, on the one hand, to avoid that an aircraft passes its stop point and goes on the apron service road or to the closest building and on the other hand, to save fuel and optimise the manoeuvrability of the aircraft or of the push-back device.</para>
              <para>(c)Where the slope limitation of 1&#160;% on the stands cannot be achieved, the slope should be kept as shallow as possible and should be such that the operation of the aircraft and vehicles is not compromised.</para>

              <para>(1)an inner area for parking of an aeroplane to be treated; and</para>
              <para>(2)an outer area for movement of two or more mobile de-icing/anti-icing equipment.</para>
              <para>(d)Where more than one de-icing/anti-icing pad is provided, consideration should be given to providing de-icing/anti-icing vehicle movement areas of adjacent pads that do not overlap but are exclusive for each pad. Consideration should also be given to bypassing of the area by other aeroplanes with the clearances specified in CS ADR-DSN.G.400.</para>

              <para>(a)The obstacle limitation surfaces define the limits to which objects may project into the airspace. Each surface is related to one or more phases of a flight, and provides protection to aircraft during that phase.</para>
              <para>(b)The OLS also help to prevent the aerodromes from becoming unusable by the growth of obstacles around the aerodromes.</para>
              <para>(c)The effective utilisation of an aerodrome may be considerably influenced by natural features and man-made constructions outside its boundary. These may result in limitations on the distance available for take-off and landing and on the range of meteorological conditions in which take-off and landing can be undertaken. For these reasons, certain areas of the local airspace should be regarded as integral parts of the aerodrome environment.</para>
              <para>(d)Objects which penetrate the obstacle limitation surfaces may in certain circumstances cause an increase in the obstacle clearance altitude/height for an instrument approach procedure or any associated visual circling procedure or have other operational impact on flight procedure design. Criteria for flight procedure design are contained in the Procedures for Air Navigation Services &#8212; Aircraft Operations (ICAO, PANS-OPS, Doc 8168).</para>
              <para>(e)In ideal circumstances all the surfaces should be free from obstacles but when a surface is infringed, any safety measures required should have regard to:</para>
              <para>(1)the nature of the obstacle and its location relative to the surface origin, to the extended centre line of the runway or normal approach and departure paths, and to existing obstructions;</para>
              <para>(2)the amount by which the surface is infringed;</para>
              <para>(3)the gradient presented by the obstacle to the surface origin;</para>
              <para>(4)the type of air traffic at the aerodrome; and</para>
              <para>(5)the instrument approach procedures published for the aerodrome.</para>
              <para>(f)Safety measures could be as follows:</para>

              <para>(2)marking and/or lighting of the obstacle;</para>

              <para>(g)In addition to the requirements described in the certification specifications of Chapter H, it may be necessary to call for other restrictions to development and construction on and in the vicinity of the aerodrome in order to protect the performance of visual and electronic aids to navigation and to ensure that such development does not adversely affect instrument approach procedures and the associated obstacle clearance limits.</para>

              <para>(a)The outer horizontal surface should extend from the periphery of the conical surface as shown in Figure GM-H-1. An outer horizontal surface is a specified portion of a horizontal plane around an aerodrome beyond the limits of the conical surface. It represents the level above which consideration needs to be given to the control of new obstacles in order to facilitate practicable and efficient instrument approach procedures, and together with the conical and inner horizontal surfaces to ensure safe visual manoeuvring in the vicinity of an aerodrome.</para>
              <para>(b)The outer horizontal surface is of particular importance for safe operations in areas of high ground or where there are concentrations of obstacles.</para>
              <para>(c)In the experience of some States, operational problems can arise from the erection of tall structures in the vicinity of aerodromes beyond the areas currently recognised in these aerodrome regulations and ICAO Annex 14 as areas in which restriction of new construction may be necessary. Such problems may be addressed through the provision of an outer horizontal surface, which is a specified portion of a horizontal plane around an aerodrome beyond the limits of the conical surface. It represents the level above which consideration needs to be given to the control of new obstacles in order to facilitate practicable and efficient instrument approach procedures, and together with the conical and inner horizontal surfaces to ensure safe visual manoeuvring in the vicinity of an aerodrome.</para>
              <para>(d)As a broad specification for the outer horizontal surface, tall structures can be considered to be of possible significance if they are both higher than 30&#160;m above local ground level, and higher than 150&#160;m above aerodrome elevation within a radius of 15&#160;000 m of the centre of the airport where the runway code number is 3 or 4. The area of concern may need to be extended to coincide with the PANS OPS obstacle areas for the individual approach procedures at the airport under consideration.</para>

              <para>(a)The shape of the inner horizontal surface need not necessarily be circular. Guidance on determining the extent of the inner horizontal surface is contained in the ICAO Doc 9137, Airport Services Manual, Part 6, Control of Obstacles.</para>
              <para>(b)The limits of the inner horizontal surface for longer runways (1&#160;800&#160;m or more in length) are defined as circles of radius 4&#160;000&#160;m centred on the strip ends of the runway. These circles are joined by common tangents parallel to the runway centre line to form a racetrack pattern. The boundary of this pattern is the boundary of the inner horizontal surface.</para>
              <para>(c)For runways less than 1&#160;800&#160;m in length, the inner horizontal surface may be defined as a circle centred on the midpoint of the runway.</para>
              <para>(d)To protect two or more runways, a more complex pattern could become necessary. In this situation, all the circles are joined tangentially by straight lines: illustrated at the Figure GM-H-2.</para>
              <para>(e)For relatively level runways the selection of elevation datum location is not critical, but when the thresholds differ by more than 6&#160;m, the elevation datum should regard to the factors as the elevation of the most frequent used altimeter setting datum points, minimum circling altitudes in use or required and the nature of operations at the aerodrome. For more complex inner horizontal surfaces, with runways on different levels, as shown in Figure GM-H-2, a common elevation is not essential, but where surfaces overlap, the lower surface should be regarded as dominant.</para>
              <para>(f)Further guidance is given in ICAO Doc 9137, Airport Services Manual, Part 6, Control of Obstacles.</para>

              <para>(b)When local conditions differ widely from sea level standard atmospheric conditions, it may be advisable for the slope specified in Table J-2 to be reduced. The degree of this reduction depends on the divergence between local conditions and sea level standard atmospheric conditions, and on the performance characteristics and operational requirements of the aeroplanes for which the runway is intended.</para>

It is not intended that the strip or clearway be graded to conform with the inner edge of the take-off climb surface, nor is it intended that terrain or objects which are above the take-off climb surface beyond the end of the strip or clearway, but below the level of the strip or clearway, be removed unless it is considered that they may endanger aeroplanes. Similar considerations apply at the junction of a clearway and strip where differences in transverse slopes exist.</para>
              <para>(e)The operational characteristics of aeroplanes for which the runway is intended should be examined to see if it is desirable to reduce the slope specified in Table J-2 when critical operating conditions are to be catered to. If the specified slope is reduced, corresponding adjustment in the length of the take-off climb surface should be made so as to provide protection to a height of 300&#160;m.</para>

              <para>ED Decision 2016/027/R</para>
              <para>(a)Wind direction indicators are important visual aids for all runway ends. Large wind direction indicators are particularly important at aerodromes where landing information is not available through radio communications. On the other hand, landing direction indicators are seldom used due to the necessity and, consequently, responsibility, of changing their direction as wind direction shifts. Visual ground signals for runway and taxiway serviceability are contained in ICAO Annex 2. Additional guidance is given in ICAO Doc 9157, Aerodrome Design Manual, Part&#160;4, Visual Aids, Chapter 3.</para>
              <para>(b)A fabric wind cone is generally the type preferred by pilots because it provides a general indication of wind speed. Cones that extend fully at wind speeds of about 15&#160;kt are most useful since this is the maximum crosswind landing component for small aircraft.</para>
              <para>(c)It may be possible to improve the perception by the pilot of the location of the wind direction indicator by several means notably by circular marking around this indicator. The location of at least one wind direction indicator should be marked by a circular band 15&#160;m in diameter and 1.2&#160;m wide. The band should be centred about the wind direction indicator support, and should be in a colour chosen to give adequate conspicuity, preferably white.</para>
              <para>(d)The usefulness of any visual aid is determined largely by its size, conspicuity, and location. Given conditions of good atmospheric visibility, the maximum distance at which the information available from an illuminated wind sleeve can be usefully interpreted is 1 km. Thus, in order that a pilot may make use of this information whilst on approach, the wind sleeve should be sited no farther from the runway threshold than 600&#160;m. Obstacle criteria excluded, the ideal location is 300&#160;m along the runway from the threshold and laterally displaced at 80&#160;m from the runway centre line.</para>
              <para>(e)This means, in effect, that only those aerodromes where the thresholds are less than 1&#160;200&#160;m apart can meet the minimum requirement with a single unit. Most code 3 and 4 aerodromes should require two or more units suitably sited in order to provide the best possible coverage.</para>
              <para>(f)The final choice of unit numbers and location should depend on a number of factors which should vary from aerodrome to aerodrome. However, when deciding on the most appropriate location, account should be taken to ensure that the wind direction indicator is:</para>
              <para>(1)outside the Cleared and Graded Area of the runway and taxiway strips;</para>
              <para>(2)clear of the OFZ and ILS critical/sensitive areas where appropriate;</para>
              <para>(3)preferably not more than 200&#160;m lateral displacement from the runway edge;</para>
              <para>(4)preferably between 300&#160;m and 600&#160;m from the runway threshold measured along the runway;</para>
              <para>(5)in an area with low background levels of illumination;</para>
              <para>(6)visible from the approach and take-off positions of all runways; and</para>
              <para>(7)free from the effects of air disturbance caused by nearby objects.</para>

The enhanced taxiway centre line marking should continue beyond the taxiway/taxiway intersection for at least three dashed line segments or 47&#160;m from start to finish, whichever is greater (see Figure L-6(c)).</para>
            <para>(4)Where two taxiway centre lines converge at or before the runway-holding position marking, the inner dashed line should not be less than 3&#160;m in length (see Figure L-6(d)).</para>

Where one or more sets of stand markings are superimposed on a stand marking, the lines should be continuous for the most demanding aircraft and broken for other aircraft.</para>
            <para>(2)The curved portions of lead-in, turning, and lead-out lines should have radii appropriate to the most demanding aircraft type for which the markings are intended.</para>
            <para>(3)Where it is intended that an aircraft proceeds in one direction only, arrows pointing in the direction to be followed should be added as part of the lead-in and lead-out lines.</para>

It should have a width of not less than 15&#160;cm.</para>
            <para>(f)Turn bar and stop line:</para>
            <para>(1)A turn bar should be located at right angles to the lead-in line, abeam the left pilot position at the point of initiation of any intended turn. It should have a length and width of not less than 6&#160;m and 15&#160;cm respectively, and include an arrowhead to indicate the direction of turn.</para>
            <para>(2)A stop line should be located at right angles to the alignment bar, abeam the left pilot position at the intended point of stop. It should have a length and width of not less than 6&#160;m and 15&#160;cm respectively.</para>
            <para>(3)If more than one turn bar and/or stop line is required, they should be designated for the appropriate aircraft types.</para>

              <para>(a)The distances to be maintained between the stop line and the lead-in line may vary according to different aircraft types, taking into account the pilot&#8217;s field of view.</para>
              <para>(b)Apron markings are installed to support the safe operation of aircraft on stands and apron areas. Where appropriate procedures are employed, markings may not be required, giving flexibility of operations. Examples would include situations where aircraft marshallers are used or where aircraft are required to self-park on an open apron where different combinations of aircraft preclude dedicated markings. Specific markings/stands are normally more applicable for larger aircraft.</para>

              <para>(a)Aeronautical ground lights near navigable waters should be taken into consideration to ensure that the lights do not cause confusion to mariners.</para>
              <para>(b)In dusk or poor visibility conditions by day, lighting can be more effective than marking. For lights to be effective in such conditions or in poor visibility by night, they should be of adequate intensity. To obtain the required intensity, it should usually be necessary to make the light directional, in which case the arcs over which the light shows should be adequate and so orientated as to meet the operational requirements. The runway lighting system should be considered as a whole, to ensure that the relative light intensities are suitably matched to the same end.</para>
              <para>(c)While the lights of an approach lighting system may be of higher intensity than the runway lighting, it is good practice to avoid abrupt changes in intensity as these could give a pilot a false impression that the visibility is changing during approach.</para>
              <para>(d)The conspicuity of a light depends on the impression received of contrast between the light and its background. If a light is to be useful to a pilot by day when on approach, it should have an intensity of at least 2&#160;000 or 3&#160;000&#160;cd, and in the case of approach lights an intensity of the order of 20&#160;000&#160;cd is desirable. In conditions of very bright daylight fog it may not be possible to provide lights of sufficient intensity to be effective.</para>
              <para>(e)On the other hand, in clear weather on a dark night, an intensity of the order of 100&#160;cd for approach lights and 50&#160;cd for the runway edge lights may be found suitable. Even then, owing to the closer range at which they are viewed, pilots have sometimes complained that the runway edge lights seemed unduly bright.</para>
              <para>(f)In fog the amount of light scattered is high. At night this scattered light increases the brightness of the fog over the approach area and runway to the extent that little increase in the visual range of the lights can be obtained by increasing their intensity beyond 2&#160;000 or 3&#160;000&#160;cd. In an endeavour to increase the range at which lights would first be sighted at night, their intensity should not be raised to an extent that a pilot might find excessively dazzling at diminished range.</para>
              <para>(g)From the foregoing should be evident the importance of adjusting the intensity of the lights of an aerodrome lighting system according to the prevailing conditions, so as to obtain the best results without excessive dazzle that would disconcert the pilot. The appropriate intensity setting on any particular occasion should depend both on the conditions of background brightness and the visibility.</para>
              <para>(h)Assessment on dazzle in the aerodrome vicinity:</para>
              <para>(1)Human vision is a complex mechanism using both eye and brain. Even though this mechanism is quite handled for eye, there is still a lack of knowledge on the interpretation of it by the brain. Thus, vision varies from one human being to another.</para>
              <para>(2)The field of view is defined by the area perceived by eyes. The perception of details is based on the luminance ratio between elements of the scene, taking into account spatial distribution. Luminance and contrast are key elements of vision mechanism.</para>
              <para>(3)Four sectors can be identified in the field of view (FOV):</para>
              <para>(i)sensation field, corresponding to the absolute boundaries of FOV; it opens up to approximately 90&#176; on each side of the eye direction;</para>
              <para>(ii)visibility field, which is narrower and enables the perception of an object; it opens up to 60&#176;;</para>
              <para>(iii)conspicuity field, which enables the recognition, it opens up to 30&#176;;</para>
              <para>(iv)working conspicuity field, which is further tightly centred on the eye direction (1&#176; to 2&#176;); it enables the identification and is the working area of the vision.</para>
              <para>It is reminded that the retina is composed in its centre by cone cells (that see colours and details) and at the periphery by rod cells (that perceive movements and change of state).</para>
              <para>(i)A safety assessment is conducted in order to identify situations where the risk of dazzling becomes unacceptable. Thus, it is noted that dazzle represents such a risk in the following situations:</para>
              <para>(1)during approach, especially after the aircraft has descended below the decision height: the pilot should not lose any visual cue;</para>
              <para>(2)at touchdown the pilot should not be surprised by a flash;</para>
              <para>(3)during rolling (landing or take-off), the pilot should be able to perceive his environment and detect any deviation from the centre line: the pilot should not lose any visual cue.</para>
              <para>(4)Thus:</para>
              <para>(i)prejudicial dazzle due to veiling luminance should not occur during approach (slightly before the decision height) and rolling; and</para>
              <para>(ii)surprise effect should not occur at touchdown.</para>
              <para>(j)Regarding air traffic controllers, it has been considered that dazzle induced by veiling effect should not reduce the visual perception of aircraft operations on, and close to the runway.</para>
              <para>(k)The elements here above can be applied to solar panels. The following assumptions can be made:</para>
              <para>(1)solar panels are inclined so as to efficiently capture the sunlight, conducting to a range of cross section surfaces;</para>
              <para>(2)the maximum acceptable luminance value has been fixed to 20&#160;000&#160;cd/m2; and</para>
              <para>(3)the surfaces varied from 100&#160;m2 to several hectares.</para>
              <para>(l)It is assumed that the aircraft maintains precisely its trajectory whereas in reality the approach is conducted into a conical envelop around the expected trajectory.</para>

              <para>ED Decision 2017/021/R</para>
              <para>(a)Types and characteristics</para>
              <para>(1)The approach lighting patterns that have been generally adopted are shown in Figures M-1 and M-2. A diagram of the inner 300&#160;m of the precision approach Category II and III lighting system is shown in Figures M-3A and M-3B.</para>
              <para>(2)The approach lighting configuration is to be provided irrespective of the location of the threshold, i.e. whether the threshold is at the extremity of the runway or displaced from the runway extremity. In both cases, the approach lighting system should extend up to the threshold. However, in the case of a displaced threshold, inset lights are used from the runway extremity up to the threshold to obtain the specified configuration. These inset lights are designed to satisfy the structural requirements specified in CS&#160;ADR.DSN.M.615(d)(1).The characteristics of these inset lights should be in accordance with the specifications in CS&#160;ADR-DSN.U.940, Figures U-5 or U-6, as appropriate and the chromaticity should be in accordance with the specifications in CS&#160;ADR-DSN.U.930 and Figure U-1A or U-1B, as appropriate.</para>
              <para>(3)Examples of flight path envelopes used in designing the lighting are shown in Figure GM-M-2.</para>
              <para>(b)Horizontal installation tolerances:</para>
              <para>(1)The dimensional tolerances are shown in Figure M-1 and M-2.</para>
              <para>(2)The centre line of an approach lighting system should be as coincident as possible with the extended centre line of the runway with a maximum tolerance of &#177;15&#8242;.</para>
              <para>(3)The longitudinal spacing of the centre line lights should be such that one light (or group of lights) is located in the centre of each crossbar, and the intervening centre line lights are spaced as evenly as practicable, between two crossbars or a crossbar and a threshold.</para>
              <para>(4)The crossbars and barrettes should be at right angles to the centre line of the approach lighting system with a tolerance of &#177;30&#8242; if the pattern in Figure M-2(A) is adopted or &#177; 2&#176; if Figure M-2(B) is adopted.</para>
              <para>(5)When a crossbar has to be displaced from its standard position, any adjacent crossbar should where possible, be displaced by appropriate amounts in order to reduce the differences in the crossbar spacing.</para>
              <para>(6)When a crossbar in the system shown in Figure M-2(A) is displaced from its standard position, its overall length should be adjusted so that it remains one-twentieth of the actual distance of the crossbar from the point of origin. It is not necessary, however, to adjust the standard 2.7&#160;m spacing between the crossbar lights but the crossbars should be kept symmetrical about the centre line of the approach lighting.</para>
              <para>(c)Vertical installation tolerances:</para>
              <para>(1)The ideal arrangement is to mount all the approach lights in the horizontal plane passing through the threshold as shown in Figure GM-M-1, and this should be the general aim as far as local conditions permit. However, buildings, trees, etc. should not obscure the lights from the view of a pilot who is assumed to be 1&#176; below the electronic glide path in the vicinity of the outer marker.</para>
              <para>(2)Within a stopway or clearway, and within 150&#160;m of the end of a runway, the lights should be mounted as near to the ground as local conditions permit in order to minimise risk of damage to aeroplanes in the event of an overrun or undershoot. Beyond the stopway and clearway, it is not so necessary for the lights to be mounted close to the ground, and, therefore, undulations in the ground contours can be compensated for by mounting the lights on poles of appropriate height.</para>
              <para>(3)It is desirable that the lights be mounted so that as far as possible, no object within a distance of 60&#160;m on each side of the centre line protrudes through the plane of the approach lighting system. Where a tall object exists within 60&#160;m of the centre line and within 1&#160;350&#160;m from the threshold for a precision approach lighting system, or 900&#160;m for a simple approach lighting system, it may be advisable to install the lights so that the plane of the outer half of the pattern clears the top of the object.</para>
              <para>(4)In order to avoid giving a misleading impression of the plane of the ground, the lights should not be mounted below a gradient of 1 in 66 downwards from the threshold to a point 300&#160;m out, and below a gradient of 1 in 40 beyond the 300&#160;m point. For a precision approach Category II and III lighting system, more stringent criteria may be necessary, e.g. negative slopes not permitted within 450&#160;m of the threshold.</para>
              <para>(i)Centre line. The gradients of the centre line in any section (including a stopway or clearway) should be as small as practicable, and the changes in gradients should be as few and small as can be arranged, and should not exceed 1 in 60. Experience has shown that as one proceeds outwards from the runway, rising gradients in any section of up to 1 in 66, and falling gradients of down to 1 in 40, are acceptable.</para>
              <para>(ii)Crossbars. The crossbar lights should be so arranged as to lie on a straight line passing through the associated centre line lights, and wherever possible, this line should be horizontal. It is permissible, however, to mount the lights on a transverse gradient not more than 1 in 80 if this enables crossbar lights within a stopway or clearway to be mounted nearer to the ground on sites where there is a cross-fall.</para>
              <para>(5)When the barrette is composed of lights approximating to point sources, a spacing of 1.5&#160;m between adjacent lights in the barrette has been found satisfactory.</para>
              <para>(6)At locations where identification of the simple approach lighting system is difficult at night due to surrounding lights, sequence flashing lights installed in the outer portion of the system may resolve this problem.</para>
              <para>(d)Clearance of obstacles:</para>
              <para>(1)An area, hereinafter referred to as the light plane, has been established for obstacle clearance purposes, and all lights of the system are in this plane. This plane is rectangular in shape and symmetrically located about the approach lighting system&#8217;s centre line. It starts at the threshold and extends 60&#160;m beyond the approach end of the system, and is 120&#160;m wide.</para>
              <para>(2)No objects are permitted to exist within the boundaries of the light plane which are higher than the light plane except as designated herein. All roads and highways are considered as obstacles extending 4.8&#160;m above the crown of the road, except aerodrome service roads where all vehicular traffic is under control of the aerodrome operator and coordinated with the aerodrome air traffic control. Railroads, regardless of the amount of traffic, are considered as obstacles extending 5.4&#160;m above the top of the rails.</para>
              <para>(3)It is recognised that some components of electronic landing aids systems, such as reflectors, antennas, monitors, etc. should be installed above the light plane. Every effort should be made to relocate such components outside the boundaries of the light plane. In the case of reflectors and monitors, this can be done in many instances.</para>
              <para>(4)Where an ILS localiser is installed within the light plane boundaries, it is recognised that the localiser, or screen if used, should extend above the light plane. In such cases, the height of these structures should be held to a minimum and they should be located as far from the threshold as possible. In general, the rule regarding permissible heights is 15&#160;cm for each 30&#160;m the structure is located from the threshold. As an example, if the localiser is located 300&#160;m from the threshold, the screen should be permitted to extend above the plane of the approach lighting system by 10 &#215; 15 = 150&#160;cm maximum but preferably should be kept as low as possible, consistent with proper operation of the ILS.</para>
              <para>(5)In locating an MLS azimuth antenna the guidance contained in ICAO Annex 10, Volume I, Attachment G, should be followed. This material which also provides guidance on collocating an MLS azimuth antenna with an ILS localiser antenna, suggests that the MLS azimuth antenna may be sited within the light plane boundaries where it is not possible or practical to locate it beyond the outer end of the approach lighting for the opposite direction of approach. If the MLS azimuth antenna is located on the extended centre line of the runway, it should be as far as possible from the closest light position to the MLS azimuth antenna in the direction of the runway end. Furthermore, the MLS azimuth antenna phase centre should be at least 0.3&#160;m above the light centre of the light position closest to the MLS azimuth antenna in the direction of the runway end. (This could be relaxed to 0.15&#160;m if the site is otherwise free of significant multipath problems.)</para>
              <para>(6)Compliance with this requirement which is intended to ensure that the MLS signal quality is not affected by the approach lighting system, could result in the partial obstruction of the lighting system by the MLS azimuth antenna. To ensure that the resulting obstruction does not degrade visual guidance beyond an acceptable level, the MLS azimuth antenna should not be located closer to the runway end than 300&#160;m and the preferred location is 25&#160;m beyond the 300&#160;m crossbar (this would place the antenna 5&#160;m behind the light position 330&#160;m from the runway end). Where an MLS azimuth antenna is so located, a central part of the 300&#160;m crossbar of the approach lighting system would alone be partially obstructed. Nevertheless, it is important to ensure that the unobstructed lights of the crossbar remain serviceable all the time.</para>
              <para>(7)Objects existing within the boundaries of the light plane, requiring the light plane to be raised in order to meet the criteria contained herein, should be removed, lowered, or relocated where this can be accomplished more economically than raising the light plane.</para>
              <para>(8)In some instances objects may exist which cannot be removed, lowered, or relocated economically. These objects may be located so close to the threshold that they cannot be cleared by the 2&#160;% slope. Where such conditions exist and no alternative is possible, the 2&#160;% slope may be exceeded or a &#8216;stair step&#8217; resorted to in order to keep the approach lights above the objects. Such &#8216;step&#8217; or increased gradients should be resorted to only when it is impracticable to follow standard slope criteria, and they should be held to the absolute minimum. Under this criterion no negative slope is permitted in the outermost portion of the system.</para>
              <para>(e)Consideration of the effects of reduced lengths:</para>
              <para>(1)The need for an adequate approach lighting system to support precision approaches where the pilot is required to acquire visual references prior to landing, cannot be stressed too strongly. The safety and regularity of such operations is dependent on this visual acquisition. The height above runway threshold at which the pilot decides there are sufficient visual cues to continue the precision approach and land, should vary, depending on the type of approach being conducted and other factors such as meteorological conditions, ground and airborne equipment, etc. The required length of approach lighting system which should support all the variations of such approaches is 900&#160;m, and this should always be provided whenever possible.</para>
              <para>(2)However, there are some runway locations where it is impossible to provide the 900&#160;m length of approach lighting system to support precision approaches.</para>
              <para>(3)In such cases, every effort should be made to provide as much approach lighting system as possible. Restrictions on operations could be imposed on runways equipped with reduced lengths of approach lighting. There are many factors which determine at what height the pilot should have decided to continue the approach to land or execute a missed approach. It should be understood that the pilot does not make an instantaneous judgement upon reaching a specified height. The actual decision to continue the approach and landing sequence is an accumulative process which is only concluded at the specified height. Unless lights are available prior to reaching the decision point, the visual assessment process is impaired and the likelihood of missed approaches should increase substantially. There are many operational considerations which should be taken into account in deciding if any restrictions are necessary to any precision approach and these are detailed in ICAO Annex 6.</para>
              <para>(f)For non-precision approach runways it is advisable to give consideration to the installation of a precision approach Category I lighting system or to the addition of a runway lead-in lighting system.</para>

            <para>ED Decision 2021/004/R</para>
            <para>(a)Location and composition:</para>
            <para>(1)A simple approach lighting system should consist of a row of lights on the extended centre line of the runway extending, whenever possible, over a distance of not less than 420&#160;m from the threshold with a row of lights forming a crossbar 18&#160;m or 30&#160;m in length at a distance of 300&#160;m from the threshold (see Figure M-1).</para>
            <para>(2)The certification specifications provide for the basic characteristics for simple approach lighting systems. For certain aspects of these systems, some latitude is permitted; for example, in the spacing between centre line lights and crossbar.</para>
            <para>(b)Crossbar lights:</para>
            <para>(1)The lights forming the crossbar should be as close as practicable in a horizontal straight line at right angles to, and bisected by, the line of the centre line lights.</para>
            <para>(2)The lights of the crossbar should be spaced so as to produce a linear effect, except that, when a crossbar of 30&#160;m is used, gaps may be left on each side of the centre line. These gaps should be kept to a minimum to meet local requirements, and each should not exceed 6&#160;m.</para>
            <para>(3)Spacing for the crossbar lights between 1&#160;m and 4&#160;m are in use. Gaps on each side of the centre line may improve directional guidance when approaches are made with a lateral error, and facilitate the movement of rescue and firefighting vehicles.</para>
            <para>(c)Centre line lights:</para>
            <para>(1)The lights forming the centre line should be placed at longitudinal intervals of 60&#160;m, except that when it is desired to improve the guidance, an interval of 30&#160;m may be used.</para>
            <para>(2)The innermost light should be located either 60&#160;m or 30&#160;m from the threshold, depending on the longitudinal interval selected for the centre line lights. If it is not physically possible to provide a centre line extending for a distance of 420&#160;m from the threshold, it should be extended to 300&#160;m so as to include the crossbar. If this is not possible, the centre line lights should be extended as far as practicable, and each centre line light should then consist of a barrette at least 3&#160;m in length. Subject to the approach system having a crossbar at 300&#160;m from the threshold, an additional crossbar may be provided at 150&#160;m from the threshold.</para>
            <para>(3)The system should lie as nearly as practicable in the horizontal plane passing through the threshold, provided that:</para>
            <para>(i)no object other than an ILS or MLS azimuth antenna should protrude through the plane of the approach lights within a distance of 60&#160;m from the centre line of the system; and</para>
            <para>(ii)no light other than a light located within the central part of a crossbar or a centre line barrette, excluding their extremities, should be screened from an approaching aircraft.</para>
            <para>Any ILS or MLS azimuth antenna protruding through the plane of the lights should be treated as an obstacle, and marked and lighted accordingly as specified in the requirements for obstacle marking and lighting.</para>
            <para>(d)Characteristics:</para>
            <para>(1)The lights of a simple approach lighting system should be fixed lights and the colour of the lights should be such as to ensure that the system is readily distinguishable from other aeronautical ground lights, and from extraneous lighting if present, but should be preferably fixed lights showing variable white. Each centre line light should consist of either:</para>
            <para>(i)a single source; or</para>
            <para>(ii)a barrette at least 3&#160;m in length.</para>
            <para>(e)Barrettes of 4&#160;m in length should be so designed if it is anticipated that the simple approach lighting system should be developed into a precision approach lighting system.</para>
            <para>(f)Where provided for a non-instrument runway, the lights should show at all angles in azimuth necessary to a pilot on base leg and final approach. The intensity of the lights should be adequate for all conditions of visibility and ambient light for which the system has been provided.</para>
            <para>(g)Where provided for a non-precision approach runway, the lights should show at all angles in azimuth necessary to the pilot of an aircraft which on final approach does not deviate by an abnormal amount from the path defined by the non-visual aid. The lights should be designed to provide guidance during both day and night in the most adverse conditions of visibility and ambient light for which it is intended that the system should remain usable.</para>

              <para>(a)Factors that should be considered when making a decision on which runway on an aerodrome should receive first priority for the installation of a visual approach slope indicator system are:</para>
              <para>(1)frequency of use;</para>
              <para>(2)seriousness of the hazard;</para>
              <para>(3)presence of other visual and non-visual aids;</para>

              <para>(5)frequency and type of adverse weather conditions under which the runway should be used.</para>
              <para>(b)With respect to the seriousness of the hazard, the order given in the CS ADR-DSN.M.640 may be used as a general guide. These may be summarised as:</para>
              <para>(1)inadequate visual guidance because of:</para>
              <para>(i)approaches over water or featureless terrain, or absence of sufficient extraneous light in the approach area by night;</para>
              <para>(ii)deceptive surrounding terrain.</para>
              <para>(2)serious hazard in approach;</para>
              <para>(3)serious hazard if aeroplanes undershoot or overrun; and</para>
              <para>(4)unusual turbulence.</para>
              <para>(c)The presence of other visual or non-visual aids is a very important factor. Runways equipped with ILS or MLS would generally receive the lowest priority for a visual approach slope indicator system installation. It should be remembered, though, that visual approach slope indicator systems are visual approach aids in their own right and can supplement electronic aids. When serious hazards exist and/or a substantial number of aeroplanes not equipped for ILS or MLS use a runway, priority might be given to installing a visual approach slope indicator on this runway.</para>
              <para>(d)Priority may be given to runways used by turbojet aeroplanes.</para>
              <para>(e)Where a runway threshold is temporarily displaced from the normal position and one or more of the conditions specified in paragraph (a) above exist, a PAPI should be provided except that where the code number is 1 or 2 either an APAPI may be provided.</para>

            <para>CS ADR-DSN.M.645&#160;Precision approach path indicator and Abbreviated precision approach path indicator (PAPI and APAPI)</para>
            <para>ED Decision 2017/021/R</para>
            <para>(a)A PAPI or APAPI should be in accordance with the specifications provided in paragraphs CS ADR-DSN.M.645 to CS ADR-DSN.M.655.</para>
            <para>(b)Definition and positioning:</para>
            <para>(1)The PAPI system should consist of a wing bar of four sharp transition multi-lamp (or paired single lamp) units equally spaced. The APAPI system should consist of a wing bar of two sharp transition multi-lamp (or paired single lamp) units. The PAPI and APAPI system should be located on the left side of the runway unless it is physically impracticable to do so. Where a runway is used by aircraft requiring visual roll guidance which is not provided by other external means, then a second wing bar may be provided on the opposite side of the runway for PAPI or APAPI.</para>
            <para>(2)The wing bar of a PAPI should be constructed and arranged in such a manner that a pilot making an approach should:</para>
            <para>(i)when on or close to the approach slope, see the two units nearest the runway as red and the two units farthest from the runway as white;</para>
            <para>(ii)when above the approach slope, see the one unit nearest the runway as red and the three units farthest from the runway as white; and when further above the approach slope, see all the units as white; and</para>
            <para>(iii)when below the approach slope, see the three units nearest the runway as red and the unit farthest from the runway as white; and when further below the approach slope, see all the units as red.</para>
            <para>(3)The wing bar of an APAPI should be constructed and arranged in such a manner that a pilot making an approach should:</para>
            <para>(i)when on or close to the approach slope, see the unit nearer the runway as red and the unit farther from the runway as white;</para>
            <para>(ii)when above the approach slope, see both the units as white; and</para>
            <para>(iii)when below the approach slope, see both the units as red.</para>
            <para>(4)The light units should be located as in the basic configuration illustrated in Figure M-4, subject to the installation tolerances given below. The units forming a wing bar should be mounted so as to appear to the pilot of an approaching aeroplane to be substantially in a horizontal line. The light units should be mounted as low as possible and should be frangible.</para>
            <para>(c)Characteristics:</para>
            <para>(1)The system should be suitable for both day and night operations.</para>
            <para>(2)Colour:</para>
            <para>(i)The colour transition from red to white in the vertical plane should be such as to appear to an observer, at a distance of not less than 300&#160;m, to occur within a vertical angle of not more than 3&#180;.</para>
            <para>(ii)At full intensity, the chromaticity of lights units should be in accordance with the specifications in CS ADR-DSN.U.930 and Figure U-1A or U-1B, as appropriate, and the red light should have a Y&#160;coordinate not exceeding 0.320.</para>
            <para>(3)Intensity:</para>
            <para>(i)The light intensity distribution of the light units should be as shown in CS ADR-DSN.U.940, Figure U-26.</para>
            <para>(ii)Suitable intensity control should be provided so as to allow adjustment to meet the prevailing conditions and to avoid dazzling the pilot during approach and landing.</para>
            <para>(4)Light orientation: Each light unit should be capable of adjustment in elevation so that the lower limit of the white part of the beam may be fixed at any desired angle of elevation between 1&#176;30&#180;and at least 4&#176;30&#180;above the horizontal.</para>
            <para>(5)Other characteristics: The light units should be so designed that deposits of condensation, snow, ice, dirt, or other contaminants, on optically transmitting or reflecting surfaces should interfere to the least possible extent with the light signals and should not affect the contrast between the red and white signals and the elevation of the transition sector.</para>

            <para>(3)The azimuth spread of the light beam should be suitably restricted where an object located outside the obstacle protection surface of the PAPI or APAPI system but within the lateral limits of its light beam, is found to extend above the plane of the obstacle protection surface and a safety assessment indicates that the object could adversely affect the safety of operations. The extent of the restriction should be such that the object remains outside the confines of the light beam.</para>

The lights should be located from the threshold to the end at longitudinal spacing of approximately 15&#160;m. Where the serviceability level of the runway centre line lights specified as maintenance objectives in ADR.OPS.C.015(b)(1) to (b)(3) can be demonstrated, and the runway is intended for use in runway visual range conditions of 350&#160;m or greater, the longitudinal spacing may be approximately 30 m.</para>

            <para>(3)barrettes of at least 3&#160;m length, and spaced at uniform intervals of 30 m, as shown in Figure M-8, designed so that their photometric characteristics and intensity setting afford the guidance required during take-off without dazzling the pilot of an aircraft taking off.</para>
            <para>Where necessary, provision should be made to extinguish those centre line lights, as prescribed in paragraph (2) above or reset the intensity of the approach lighting system or barrettes when the runway is being used for landing. In no case should only the single source runway centre line lights show from the beginning of the runway to a displaced threshold when the runway is being used for landing.</para>

              <para>(a)In low visibility conditions, rapid exit taxiway indicator lights provide useful situational awareness cues while allowing the pilot to concentrate on keeping the aircraft on the runway centre line.</para>
              <para>(b)Rapid exit taxiway indicator lights should be considered on a runway intended for use in runway visual range conditions less than a value of 350 m where the traffic density is heavy.</para>
              <para>(c)Rapid exit taxiway indicator lights should not be displayed in the event of any lamp failure or other failure that prevents the display of the light pattern depicted in Figure GM-M-3.</para>
              <para>(d)Following a landing, runway occupancy time has a significant effect on the achievable runway capacity. Rapid exit taxiway indicator lights allow pilots to maintain a good roll-out speed until it is necessary to decelerate to an appropriate speed for the turn into a rapid exit turn-off. A roll-out speed of 60 kt until the first RETIL (three-light barrette) is reached is seen as the optimum.</para>

              <para>(a)Runway incursions may take place in all visibility or weather conditions. The use of runway guard lights at runway-holding positions can form part of effective runway incursion prevention measures.</para>
              <para>(b)Where taxiways are substantially wider than those specified in CS&#160;ADR-DSN.D.245, such as widethroat taxiways, the lights in Configuration A, located at each of the sides, are likely to be missed by pilots and may be necessary to be supplemented by a row of lights (inset) located across the taxiway, Configuration B.</para>
              <para>(c)Higher light intensities may be required to maintain ground movement at a certain speed in low visibilities.</para>
              <para>(d)The optimum flash rate is dependent on the rise and fall times of the lamps used. Runway guard lights, Configuration A, installed on 6.6 ampere series circuits have been found to look best when operated at 45 to 50 flashes per minute per lamp. Runway guard lights, Configuration B, installed on 6.6 ampere series circuits have been found to look best when operated at 30 to 32 flashes per minute per lamp.</para>
              <para>(e)Where there is a need to enhance the contrast between the on- and off-state of runway guard lights, Configuration A, intended for use during the day, a visor of sufficient size to prevent sunlight from entering the lens without interfering with the function of the fixture should be located above each lamp.Some other device or design, e.g. special designed optics, may be used in lieu of the visor.</para>
              <para>(f)Additional guidance on runway guard lights is given in ICAO Doc 9157, Aerodrome Design Manual, Part 4, Visual Aids.</para>

            <para>(a)Applicability: A visual docking guidance system should be provided when it is intended to indicate, by a visual aid, the precise positioning of an aircraft on an aircraft stand and other alternative means, such as marshallers, are not practicable.</para>

              <para>GM1 ADR-DSN.P.825&#160;Taxiway edge markers</para>
              <para>(a)At small aerodromes, taxiway edge markers may be used, in lieu of taxiway edge lights, to delineate the edges of taxiways, particularly at night. Additional guidance is given in ICAO Doc&#160;9157, Aerodrome Design Manual, Part 4, Visual Aids.</para>
              <para>(b)On a straight section of a taxiway, taxiway edge markers should be spaced at uniform longitudinal intervals of not more than 60&#160;m. On a curve the markers should be spaced at intervals less than 60&#160;m so that a clear indication of the curve is provided. The markers should be located as near as practicable to the edges of the taxiway, or outside the edges at a distance of not more than 3&#160;m. Additional guidance is given in ICAO Doc 9157, Aerodrome Design Manual, Part 4, Visual Aids.</para>
              <para>(c)The markers commonly used are cylindrical in shape. Ideally, the design of the marker should be such that when installed properly, no portion should exceed 35&#160;cm total height above the mounting surface. However, where significant snow heights are possible, markers exceeding 35&#160;cm in height may be used but their total height should be sufficiently low to preserve clearance for propellers, and for the engine pods of jet aircraft. Additional guidance is given is ICAO Doc 9157, Aerodrome Design Manual, Part 4, Visual Aids.</para>
              <para>(d)A taxiway edge marker should be lightweight and frangible. One type of marker meeting these requirements is detailed in Figure GM-P-1. The post is made up of flexible PVC and its colour is blue. The sleeve which is retro-reflective, is also blue. Note that the area of the marked surface is 150 cm2. Additional guidance is given in ICAO Doc 9157, Aerodrome Design Manual, Part 4, Visual Aids.</para>

              <para>(d)An autonomous aircraft detection system may be installed on or near an obstacle (or group of obstacles such as wind farms) within or outside the lateral boundaries of the obstacle limitation surfaces. This system is designed to operate the lighting only when it detects an aircraft approaching the obstacle, to reduce light exposure to local residents. Additional guidance on the design and installation of an autonomous aircraft detection system is available in the ICAO Doc 9157, Aerodrome Design Manual, Part 4, Visual Aids.</para>
              <para>The inclusion of this guidance is not intended to imply that such a system has to be provided.</para>

            <para>(a)General: All fixed objects to be marked should, whenever practicable, be coloured but if this is not practicable, markers or flags should be displayed on or above them, except those objects that are sufficiently conspicuous by their shape, size, or colour need not be otherwise marked.</para>
            <para>(b)Marking by colour</para>
            <para>(1)An object should be coloured to show a chequered pattern if it has essentially unbroken surfaces, and its projection on any vertical plane equals or exceeds 4.5&#160;m in both dimensions. The pattern should consist of rectangles of not less than 1.5&#160;m and not more than 3&#160;m on a side, the corners being of the darker colour. The colours of the pattern should contrast with each other and with the background against which they should be seen.</para>
            <para>(2)An object should be coloured to show alternating contrasting bands if:</para>
            <para>(i)it has essentially unbroken surfaces, and has one dimension, horizontal or vertical, greater than 1.5&#160;m, and the other dimension, horizontal or vertical, less than 4.5&#160;m; or</para>
            <para>(ii)it is of skeletal type with either a vertical or a horizontal dimension greater than 1.5&#160;m.</para>
            <para>(3)The bands should be perpendicular to the longest dimension and have a width approximately 1/7 of the longest dimension or 30&#160;m, whichever is less. The colours of the bands should contrast with the background against which they should be seen. Orange and white should be used, except where such colours are not conspicuous when viewed against the background. The bands on the extremities of the object should be of the darker colour (see Figures Q-1 and Q-2). The dimensions of the marking band widths are shown in Table Q-4.</para>
            <para>(4)An object should be coloured in a single conspicuous colour if its projection on any vertical plane has both dimensions less than 1.5&#160;m. Orange or red should be used, except where such colours merge with the background.</para>
            <para>(c)Marking by flags</para>
            <para>(1)Flags used to mark fixed objects should be displayed around, on top of, or around the highest edge of the object. When flags are used to mark extensive objects or groups of closely spaced objects, they should be displayed at least every 15&#160;m. Flags should not increase the hazard presented by the object they mark.</para>
            <para>(2)Flags used to mark fixed objects should not be less than 0.6&#160;m on each side.</para>
            <para>(3)Flags used to mark fixed objects should be orange in colour or a combination of two triangular sections, one orange and the other white, or one red and the other white. Except where such colours merge with the background, other conspicuous colours should be used.</para>
            <para>(d)Marking by markers</para>
            <para>(1)Markers displayed on or adjacent to objects should be located in conspicuous positions so as to retain the general definition of the object and should be recognisable in clear weather from a distance of at least 1&#160;000&#160;m for an object to be viewed from the air and 300&#160;m for an object to be viewed from the ground in all directions in which an aircraft is likely to approach the object. The shape of markers should be distinctive to the extent necessary to ensure that they are not mistaken for markers employed to convey other information, and they should be such that the hazard presented by the object they mark is not increased.</para>
            <para>(2)A marker should be of one colour. When more than one markers are installed, white and red, or white and orange markers should be displayed alternately. The colour selected should contrast with the background against which it should be seen.</para>

            <para>(a)The presence of objects which should be lighted, as specified in CS&#160;ADR-DSN.Q.840 and CS&#160;ADR-DSN.Q.841 should be indicated by low-, medium- or high-intensity obstacle lights, or a combination of such lights.</para>
            <para>(b)Low-intensity obstacle lights, Types A, B, C and D, medium-intensity obstacle lights, Types A, B and C and high-intensity obstacle lights Types A and B, should be in accordance with the specifications in Table Q-1, CS ADR-DSN.U.930 and Figure U-1A or U-1B, as appropriate..</para>
            <para>(c)The number and arrangement of low-, medium- or high-intensity obstacle lights at each level to be marked should be such that the object is indicated from every angle in azimuth. Where a light is shielded in any direction by another part of the object or by an adjacent object, additional lights should be provided on that adjacent object, or the part of the object that is shielding the light, in such a way as to retain the general definition of the object to be lighted. If the shielded light does not contribute to the definition of the object to be lighted, it may be omitted.</para>
            <para>(d)In case of an object to be lighted one or more low-, medium- or high-intensity obstacle lights should be located as close as practicable to the top of the object.</para>
            <para>(e)In the case of chimney or other structure of like function, the top lights should be placed sufficiently below the top so as to minimise contamination by smoke, etc. (see Figure Q-2).</para>

            <para>(1)Penetrating a horizontal obstacle limitation surface (OLS) or located outside an OLS, the top lights should be so arranged as to at least indicate the points or edges of the object highest in relation to OLS or above the ground, and so as to indicate the general definition and the extent of the objects; and</para>
            <para>(2)Penetrating a sloping OLS, the top lights should be so arranged as to at least indicate the points or edges of the object highest in relation to the OLS, and so as to indicate the general definition and the extent of the objects. If two or more edges are of the same height, the edge nearest the landing area should be marked.</para>
            <para>(h)When the obstacle limitation surface concerned is sloping and the highest point above the obstacle limitation surface is not the highest point of the object, additional obstacle lights should be placed on the highest point of the object.</para>

              <para>(b)High-intensity obstacle lights are intended for day use as well as night use. Care should be taken to ensure that these lights do not create disconcerting dazzle or environmental concerns.

              <para>(c)Where the use of high-intensity obstacle lights, Type B, at night may dazzle pilots in the vicinity of an aerodrome (within approximately 10&#160;000&#160;m radius) or cause significant environmental concerns, a dual obstacle lighting system should be provided. This system should be composed of high-intensity obstacle lights, Type B, for daytime and twilight use and medium-intensity obstacle lights, Type B, for night-time use. Where medium-intensity lights are used they should be installed at the same level as the high-intensity obstacle light Type B.</para>

              <para>(a)Unserviceability markers and lights are used for such purposes as warning pilots of a hole in a taxiway, or apron pavement, or outlining a portion of pavement, such as on an apron, that is under repair. They are not suitable for use when a portion of a runway becomes unserviceable, nor on a taxiway when a major portion of the width becomes unserviceable. In such instances, the runway or taxiway is normally closed.</para>
              <para>(b)The spacing required for marking and lights should take into account visibility conditions, geometric configurations of the area, potential height differences of terrain so that the limits of unserviceable area is readily visible to pilot.</para>
              <para>(c)Where a temporarily unserviceable area exists, it may be marked with fixed-red lights. These lights mark the most potentially dangerous extremities of the area.</para>
              <para>(d)A minimum of four such lights may be used, except where the area is triangular in shape, in which case a minimum of three lights may be used.</para>
              <para>(e)The number of lights may be increased when the area is large or of unusual configuration. At least one light should be installed for each 7.5&#160;m of peripheral distance of the area.</para>
              <para>(f)If the lights are directional, they should be orientated so that as far as possible, their beams are aligned in the direction from which aircraft or vehicles should approach.</para>
              <para>(g)Where aircraft or vehicles should normally approach from several directions, consideration should be given to adding extra lights or using omnidirectional lights to show the area from these directions.</para>
              <para>(h)Unserviceable area lights should be frangible. Their height should be sufficiently low to preserve clearance for propellers and for engine pods of jet aircraft.</para>

              <para>(a)The safety of operations at aerodromes depends on the quality of the supplied power. The total electrical power supply system may include connections to one or more external sources of electric power supply, one or more local generating facilities, and to a distribution network including transformers and switchgear. Many other aerodrome facilities supplied from the same system need to be taken into account while planning the electrical power system at aerodromes.</para>
              <para>(b)The design and installation of the electrical systems need to take into consideration factors that can lead to malfunction, such as electromagnetic disturbances, line losses, power quality, etc. Additional guidance is given in ICAO Doc 9157, Aerodrome Design Manual, Part 5, Electrical Systems.</para>
              <para>(c)Switch-over time is the time required for the actual intensity of a light measured in a given direction to fall from 50&#160;% and recover to 50&#160;% during a power supply changeover, when the light is being operated at intensities of 25&#160;% or above.</para>
              <para>(d)As a good practice, a measurement of the photometric parameters may be used for the evaluation of the switch-over time.</para>
              <para>(1)If the switch-over time is greater than 1 second, the following corrective actions may be used to decrease the switch-over time:</para>
              <para>(i)use of enhanced constant current regulators (CCR); or</para>
              <para>(ii)use of uninterruptible power supply (UPS).</para>
              <para>(2)If the photometric based switch-over time is below or equal 1 second, it is recommended to analyse the electrical system in order to find out an equivalent electrical switch-over time.</para>
              <para>(e)For periodic measurement of the switch-over time a measurement of the equivalent electrical switch-over time at the feeding point of an aeronautical ground lights (AGL) system may be established.</para>

              <para>GM1 ADR-DSN.T.900&#160;Emergency access and service roads</para>
              <para>ED Decision 2016/027/R</para>
              <para>(a)Service roads at air side are installed to support all apron processes. Furthermore, service roads can be used as aerodrome perimeter service roads, providing access to navigation aids, as temporary roads for construction vehicles, etc.</para>
              <para>(b)Some general considerations in the planning of roads are described as follows:</para>
              <para>(1)Every effort should be made to plan service roads at air side so that they do not cross runways and taxiways.</para>
              <para>(2)The planning of the aerodrome road layout should take into account the need to provide emergency access roads for use by rescue and firefighting vehicles to various areas on the aerodrome, and, in particular, to the approach areas. Service roads to navigation aids should be planned in such a manner as to present minimal interference to the function of the aids. If it is necessary for a service road to cross an approach area, the road should be located so that vehicles travelling on it are not obstacles to aircraft operations.</para>
              <para>(3)The service roads at air side system should be designed to account for local security measures. Access points to the system should, thus, need to be restricted. Should ground vehicle movements affect surface movement of aircraft on runways and taxiways, it should be required that the ground vehicle movements be coordinated by the appropriate aerodrome control. Control is normally exercised by means of two-way radio communication although visual signals, such as signal lamps, are adequate when traffic at the aerodrome is light. Signs or signals may also be employed to aid control at intersections.</para>
              <para>(4)At intersections with runways consideration should be given to providing runway guard lights or road-holding position lights as part of the aerodrome&#8217;s runway incursion prevention programme. Runway guard lights should conform to the specifications provided in CS ADR-DSN.M.745.</para>
              <para>(5)Roads should be designed and constructed to prevent FOD transfer to the runway and taxiways.</para>
              <para>(6)Roads within 90&#160;m of a runway centre line generally should be surfaced to prevent surface erosion, and the transfer of debris to the runway and taxiways.</para>
              <para>(7)To facilitate the control and maintenance of the fencing, a perimeter service road should be constructed inside the aerodrome fencing.</para>
              <para>(8)Perimeter service road is also used by security patrols.</para>
              <para>(9)Where a fence is provided, the need for convenient access to outside areas should be taken into account. These access points should be of a suitable size to accommodate the passage of the largest RFFS vehicle in the aerodrome&#8217;s fleet.</para>
              <para>(10)When greater security is thought necessary, a cleared area should be provided on both sides of the fence or barrier to facilitate the work of patrols, and to make trespassing more difficult.</para>
              <para>(11)Special measures should be required to prevent the access of an unauthorised person to runways or taxiways which overpass public roads.</para>
              <para>(c)Emergency access roads should be considered on an aerodrome so as to facilitate achieving minimum response times for RFF vehicles.</para>
              <para>(d)Emergency access roads should be provided on an aerodrome where terrain conditions permit their construction, so as to facilitate achieving minimum response times. Particular attention should be given to the provision of ready access to approach areas up to 1&#160;000&#160;m from the threshold, or at least within the aerodrome boundary.</para>
              <para>(e)Emergency access roads are not intended for use for the functions of aerodrome service roads. Therefore, it is possible to provide different access control which should be clearly visible for all service ground traffic. Road-holding position markings, lights, or runway guard lights are not necessary if the access to an emergency access road is ensured for RFF only.</para>
              <para>(f)Aerodrome service roads may serve as emergency access roads when they are suitably located and constructed.</para>
              <para>(g)Emergency access roads should be capable of supporting the heaviest vehicles which should use them, and be usable in all weather conditions. Roads within 90&#160;m of a runway centre line should be surfaced to prevent surface erosion and the transfer of debris to the runway. Sufficient vertical clearance should be provided from overhead obstructions for the largest vehicles.</para>
              <para>(h)When the surface of the road is indistinguishable from the surrounding area, or in areas where snow may obscure the location of the roads, edge markers should be placed at intervals of about 10&#160;m.</para>

              <para>(a)The fence or barrier should be located so as to separate the movement area and other facilities or zones on the aerodrome vital to the safe operation of aircraft from areas open to public access.</para>
              <para>(b)Consideration should be given to the provision of a perimeter road inside the aerodrome fencing for the use of both maintenance personnel and security patrols.</para>
              <para>(c)Special measures may be required to prevent the access of an unauthorised person to runways or taxiways which overpass public roads.</para>
              <para>(d)Fencing can vary in design, height, and type depending on local needs. Generally, it is recommended that the fencing be galvanized steel, chain link fabric installed to a height of 2,5&#160;m, and topped with a three-strand barbed wire overhang. The latter should have a minimum 15&#160;cm separation between strands and extend outward at 45-degree angle from the horizontal. Fence posts should be installed at no greater than 3&#160;m intervals and be located within 5&#160;cm of any wall or structure forming part of the perimeter. Gates should be constructed with material of comparable strength and durability, and open to an angle of at least 90 degrees. Hinges should be such as to preclude unauthorised removal.</para>
              <para>(e)Top and bottom selvages of the fence having a twisted and barbed finish. The bottom of the fence installed to within 5&#160;cm of hard surfacing or stabilised soil. However, in areas where unstable soil conditions are prevalent, the fabric installed to extend at least 5&#160;cm below the surface or imbedded in concrete curbing. All fencing should be grounded. Care should be taken that metallic fencing is not installed when it should interface with the operation of navigation aids. The fence itself should allow clear visibility and easy maintenance.</para>
              <para>(f)The number of gates should be limited to the minimum required for the safe and efficient operation of the facility. Access points should need to be made in the fence to allow the passage of authorised vehicles and persons. While the number of access points should be kept to a minimum, adequate access points should be planned for routine operations, maintenance and emergency operations.</para>

              <para>ED Decision 2017/021/R</para>
              <para>(a)The implementation of autonomous systems are generally quite complex in design and operation and, as such, deserves careful consideration by all involved parties such as aerodrome operators, air traffic services (ATS) and aircraft operators. This guidance provides a more clear description of the system(s) and offer some suggested actions required in order to properly implement this system(s) at an aerodrome.</para>
              <para>(b)An ARIWS may be installed in conjunction with enhanced taxiway centre line markings, stop bars or runway guard lights.</para>
              <para>(c)The system(s) should be operational under all weather conditions, including low visibility.</para>
              <para>(d)An ARIWS may share common sensory components of a surface movement guidance and control system (SMGCS) or advanced surface movement guidance and control system (ASMGCS), however, it operates independently of either system.</para>
              <para>(e)General description:</para>
              <para>(1)The operation of an ARIWS is based upon a surveillance system which monitors the actual situation on a runway and automatically returns this information to warning lights at the runway (take-off) thresholds and entrances. When an aircraft departs from a runway (rolling) or arrives at a runway (short final), red warning lights at the entrances will illuminate, indicating that it is unsafe to enter or cross the runway. When an aircraft is aligned on the runway for take-off and another aircraft or vehicle enters or crosses the runway, red warning lights will illuminate at the threshold area, indicating that it is unsafe to start the take-off roll.</para>
              <para>(2)In general, an ARIWS consists of an independent surveillance system (primary radar, multilateration, specialised cameras, dedicated radar, etc.) and a warning system in the form of extra airfield lighting systems connected through a processor that generates alerts independent from the air traffic control (ATC) directly to the flight crews and vehicle operators.</para>
              <para>(3)An ARIWS does not require circuit interleaving, secondary power supply or operational connection to other visual aid systems.</para>
              <para>(4)In practice, not every entrance or threshold needs to be equipped with warning lights. Each aerodrome will have to assess its needs individually, depending on the characteristics of the aerodrome. There are several systems developed offering the same or similar functionality.</para>
              <para>(f)Flight crew actions:</para>
              <para>(1)It is of critical importance that flight crews understand the warning being transmitted by the ARIWS system. Warnings are provided in near real-time directly to the flight crew because there is no time for &#8216;relay&#8217; types of communications. In other words, a conflict warning generated to ATS which must then interpret the warning, evaluate the situation and communicate to the aircraft in question, would result in several seconds being taken up where each second is critical in the ability to stop the aircraft safely and prevent a potential collision. Pilots are presented with a globally consistent signal which means &#8216;STOP IMMEDIATELY&#8217; and should be taught to react accordingly. Likewise, pilots receiving an ATS clearance to take-off or cross a runway, and seeing the red light array, should STOP and advise ATS that they aborted/stopped because of the red lights. Again, the criticality of the timeline involved is so tight that there is no room for misinterpretation of the signal. It is of utmost importance that the visual signal be consistent around the world.</para>
              <para>(2)It also has to be stressed that the extinguishing of the red lights does not, in itself, indicate a clearance to proceed. That clearance is still required from ATC. The absence of red warning lights only means that potential conflicts have not been detected.</para>
              <para>(3)In the event that a system becomes unserviceable, one of two things will occur. If the system fails in the extinguished condition, then no procedural changes need to be accomplished. The only thing that will happen is the loss of the automatic, independent warning system. Both ATS operations and flight crew procedures (in response to ATS clearances) will remain unchanged.</para>
              <para>(4)Procedures should be developed to address the circumstance where the system fails in the illuminated condition. It will be up to the ATS and/or aerodrome operator to establish those procedures depending on their own circumstances. It must be remembered that flight crews are instructed to &#8216;STOP&#8217; at all red lights. If the affected portion of the system, or the entire system, is shut off the situation is reverted to the extinguished scenario described in the previous paragraph.</para>
              <para>(g)Aerodromes:</para>
              <para>(1)An ARIWS does not have to be provided at all aerodromes. An aerodrome considering the installation of such a system may wish to assess its needs individually, depending on traffic levels, aerodrome geometry, ground taxi patterns, etc. Local user groups such as the local runway safety team (LRST) may be of assistance in this process. Also, not every runway or taxiway needs to be equipped with the lighting array(s), and not every installation requires a comprehensive ground surveillance system to feed information to the conflict detection computer.</para>
              <para>(2)Although there may be local specific requirements, some basic system requirements are applicable to all ARIWS:</para>
              <para>(i)the control system and energy power supply of the system should be independent from any other system in use at the aerodrome, especially the other parts of the lighting system;</para>
              <para>(ii)the system should operate independently from ATS communications;</para>
              <para>(iii)the system should provide a globally accepted visual signal that is consistent and instantly understood by crews; and</para>
              <para>(iv)local procedures should be developed in the case of malfunction or failure of a portion of or the entire system.</para>
              <para>(h)Air traffic services:</para>
              <para>(1)The ARIWS is designed to be complementary to normal ATS functions, providing warnings to flight crews and vehicle operators when some conflict has been unintentionally created or missed during normal aerodrome operations. The ARIWS will provide a direct warning when, for example, ground control or tower (local) control has provided a clearance to hold short of a runway but the flight crew or vehicle operator has &#8216;missed&#8217; the hold short portion of their clearance and the tower has issued a take-off or landing clearance to that same runway, and the &#8216;non-read back&#8217; by the flight crew or vehicle operator was missed by ATC.</para>
              <para>(2)In the case where a clearance has been issued and a crew reports a non-compliance due to &#8216;red lights&#8217;, or aborts because of &#8216;red lights&#8217;, then it is imperative that the controller assess the situation and provide additional instructions, as necessary. It may well be that the system has generated a false warning or that the potential incursion no longer exists; however, it may also be a valid warning. In any case, additional instructions and/or a new clearance need to be provided. In the case where the system has failed, then procedures will need to be put into place, as described in paragraphs (f)(3) and (f)(4) above. In no case should the illumination of the ARIWS be dismissed without confirmation that, in fact, there is no conflict. It is worth noting that there have been numerous incidents avoided at aerodromes with such systems installed. It is also worth noting that there have been false warnings as well, usually as a result of the calibration of the warning software, but in any case, the potential conflict existence or non-existence should be confirmed.</para>
              <para>(3)While many installations may have a visual or audio warning available to ATS personnel, it is in no way intended that ATS personnel be required to actively monitor the system. Such warnings may assist ATS personnel in quickly assessing the conflict in the event of a warning and help them to provide appropriate further instructions, but the ARIWS should not play an active part in the normal functioning of any ATS facility.</para>
              <para>(4)Each aerodrome where the system is installed should develop procedures depending upon its unique situation. Again, it has to be stressed that under no circumstances should pilots or operators be instructed to &#8216;cross the red lights&#8217;. As indicated above, the use of local runway safety teams may greatly assist in the development of this process.</para>
              <para>(i)Promulgation of information:</para>
              <para>(1)Specifications on providing information in the aeronautical information publication (AIP) are given in ICAO Annex&#160;15, Aeronautical Information Services. Information on the characteristics and status of an ARIWS at an aerodrome is promulgated in the AIP Section AD&#160;2.9, and its status updated as necessary through notice to airmen (NOTAM) or automatic terminal information service (ATIS).</para>
              <para>(2)Aircraft operators are to ensure that flight crews&#8217; documentation include procedures regarding ARIWS and appropriate guidance in compliance with ICAO Annex&#160;6, Operation of Aircraft, Part&#160;I.</para>
              <para>(3)Aerodromes may provide additional sources of guidance on operations and procedures for their personnel, aircraft operators, ATS and third-party personnel that may have to deal with an ARIWS.</para>

              <para>It is not possible to establish specifications for colours such that there is no possibility of confusion. For reasonably certain recognition, it is important that the eye illumination be well above the threshold of perception, that the colour not be greatly modified by selective atmospheric attenuations and that the observer&#8217;s colour vision be adequate. There is also a risk of confusion of colour at an extremely high level of eye illumination such as may be obtained from a high-intensity source at very close range. Experience indicates that satisfactory recognition can be achieved if due attention is given to these factors.</para>

            <para>(1)The colour of aeronautical ground lights should be verified as being within the boundaries specified in Figure U-1A or U-1B, as appropriate, by measurement at five points within the area limited by the innermost isocandela curve in the isocandela diagrams in CS ADR DSN.U.940, with operation at rated current or voltage. In the case of elliptical or circular isocandela curves, the colour measurements should be taken at the centre and at the horizontal and vertical limits. In the case of rectangular isocandela curves, the colour measurements should be taken at the centre and the limits of the diagonals (corners). In addition, the colour of the light should be checked at the outermost isocandela curve to ensure that there is no colour shift that might cause signal confusion to the pilot.</para>
            <para>(2)In the case of visual approach slope indicators and other light units having a colour transition sector, the colour should be measured at points in accordance with paragraph CS ADR-DSN.U.930(e)(1) above, except that the colour areas should be treated separately and no point should be within 0.5 degrees of the transition sector.</para>

            <para>Collective notes to Figures U-5 to U-15</para>
            <para>(a)The ellipses in each Figure are symmetrical about the common vertical and horizontal axes.</para>
            <para>(b)Figures U-5 to U-14 show the minimum allowable light intensities. The average intensity of the main beam is calculated by establishing grid points as shown in Figure U-15 and using the intensity value measures at all grid points located within and on the perimeter of the ellipse representing the main beam. The average value is the arithmetic average of light intensities measured at all considered grid points.</para>
            <para>(c)No deviations are acceptable in the main beam pattern when the lighting fixture is properly aimed.</para>
            <para>(d)Average intensity ratio. The ratio between the average intensity within the ellipse defining the main beam of a typical new light and the average light intensity of the main beam of a new runway edge light should be as follows:</para>
            <para>(e)The beam coverages in the Figures provide the necessary guidance for approaches down to an RVR of the order of 150&#160;m and take-offs down to an RVR of the order of 100&#160;m.</para>
            <para>(f)Horizontal angles are measured with respect to the vertical plane through the runway centre line. For lights other than centre line lights, the direction towards the runway centre line is considered positive. Vertical angles are measured with respect to the horizontal plane.</para>
            <para>(g)Where, for approach centre line lights and crossbars and for approach side row lights, inset lights are used in lieu of elevated lights, e.g. on a runway with a displaced threshold, the intensity requirements can be met by installing two or three fittings (lower intensity) at each position.</para>
            <para>(h)The importance of adequate maintenance cannot be overemphasised. The average intensity should never fall to a value less than 50&#160;% of the value shown in the Figures, and it should be the aim of aerodrome operator to maintain a level of light output close to the specified minimum average intensity.</para>
            <para>(i)The light unit should be installed so that the main beam is aligned within one-half degree of the specified.</para>

              <para>(a)Consultations with helicopter operators could assist the aerodrome operator in determining the appropriate slope category to apply according to the heliport environment and the most critical helicopter type for which the heliport is intended.</para>
              <para>Figure GM1-E-1. Example of raised inclined plane during operations in performance class 1</para>
              <para>(b)The example shown in Figure GM1-E-1 does not represent any specific profile, technique or helicopter type and is intended to show a generic example. An approach profile and a back-up procedure for departure profile are depicted. Specific manufacturers operations in performance class 1 may be represented differently in the specific helicopter (aircraft) flight manual (HFM).</para>
              <para>(c)The approach/landing profile may not be the reverse of the take-off profile.</para>
              <para>(d)Additional safety assessment for obstacles might be required in the area that a back-up procedure is intended. Helicopter performance and the HFM limitations would determine the extent of the assessment required.</para>
              <para>(e)For heliports intended to be used by helicopters operated in performance class 2 and 3, it is good practice for the approach paths to be selected so as to permit safe forced landing or one-engine-inoperative landings such that, as a minimum requirement, injury to persons on the ground or water or damage to property are minimised. The most critical helicopter type for which the heliport is intended and the ambient conditions may be factors in determining the suitability of such areas.</para>
              <para>(f)The approach and take-off surfaces should be offset from each other ideally by an angle of not less than 135&#160;degrees.</para>

            <para>(a)Applicability: The purpose of the take-off climb surface is to protect a helicopter on take-off and during climb-out.</para>
            <para>(b)Description: An inclined plane, a combination of planes or, when a turn is involved, a complex surface sloping upwards from the end of the safety area and centred on a line passing through the centre of the FATO (see Figures E-1, E-2, E-3, and E-4, and Table E-1).</para>
            <para>(c)Characteristics:</para>
            <para>(1)The limits of a take-off climb surface should comprise:</para>
            <para>(i)an inner edge horizontal and equal in length to the minimum specified width/diameter of the FATO plus the safety area, perpendicular to the centre line of the take-off climb surface and located at the outer edge of the safety area;</para>

            <para>(2)The elevation of the inner edge should be the elevation of the FATO at the point on the inner edge that is intersected by the centre line of the take-off climb surface. For heliports intended to be used by helicopters operated in performance class 1, the inclined plane may be raised directly above the FATO.</para>
            <para>(3)Where a clearway is provided the elevation of the inner edge of the take-off climb surface should be located at the outer edge of the clearway at the highest point on the ground based on the centre line of the clearway.</para>
            <para>(4)In the case of a straight take-off climb surface, the slope should be measured in the vertical plane containing the centre line of the surface.</para>
            <para>(5)In the case of a take-off climb surface involving a turn, the surface should be a complex surface containing the horizontal normals to its centre line and the slope of the centre line should be the same as that for a straight take-off climb surface (see Figure E-3).</para>
            <para>(6)In the case of a take-off climb surface involving a turn, the surface should not contain more than one curved portion.</para>
            <para>(7)Where a curved portion of a take-off climb surface is provided, the sum of the radius of the arc defining the centre line of the take-off climb surface and the length of the straight portion originating at the inner edge should not be less than 575&#160;m.</para>
            <para>(8)Any variation in the direction of the centre line of a take-off climb surface should be designed so as not to necessitate a turn of radius less than 270&#160;m.</para>

            <para>(a)Applicability: Where provided at a heliport, a flight path alignment guidance marking (or markings) should indicate the available approach and/or departure path direction(s).</para>
            <para>(b)Location: The flight path alignment guidance marking should be located in a straight line along the direction of approach and/or departure path on one or more of the TLOF, FATO, safety area or any suitable surface in the immediate vicinity of the FATO or the safety area.</para>

            <para>(1)A flight path alignment guidance marking should consist of one or more arrows marked on the TLOF, FATO and/or safety area surface, as shown in Figure F-6. The stroke of the arrow(s) should be 50&#160;cm in width and at least 3&#160;m in length. When combined with a flight path alignment guidance lighting system, it should take the form shown in Figure F-6, which includes the scheme for marking the &#8216;heads of the arrows&#8217;, which are always of the same size, regardless of the stroke length.</para>
            <para>(2)In the case of a flight path limited to a single approach direction or a single departure direction, the arrow marking may be unidirectional. In the case of a heliport with only a single approach/departure path available, one bidirectional arrow is marked.</para>
            <para>(3)The markings should be in a colour, preferably white, which provides good contrast against the background colour of the surface on which they are marked.</para>

            <para>(c)Location:</para>
            <para>(1)A visual approach slope indicator should be located such that a helicopter is guided to the desired position within the FATO and so as to avoid dazzling the pilot during final approach and landing.</para>
            <para>(2)The light unit(s) should be mounted as low as possible.</para>
            <para>(d)Characteristics of the HAPI signal format:</para>
            <para>(1)The signal format of the HAPI should include four discrete signal sectors, providing an &#8216;above slope&#8217;, an &#8216;on slope&#8217;, a &#8216;slightly below&#8217; and a &#8216;below slope&#8217; signal.</para>

            <para>(2)The angle of elevation setting of a HAPI should be such that during an approach, the pilot of a helicopter observing the upper boundary of the &#8216;below slope&#8217; signal would clear all objects in the approach area by a safe margin.</para>
            <para>(g)Characteristics of the light unit:</para>
            <para>(1)The system should be so designed that:</para>
            <para>(i)in the event the vertical misalignment of a unit exceeds &#177;&#160;0.5&#160;degrees (&#177;&#160;30&#160;minutes), the system should switch off automatically; and</para>

            <para>(5)Where a safety assessment indicates that an existing object extending above an obstacle protection surface could adversely affect the safety of operations of helicopters, one or more of the following measures should be taken:</para>
            <para>(i)suitably raise the approach slope of the system;</para>

              <para>(a)General: If it is not possible to display obstacle lights on obstacles at a heliport intended for use at night, the obstacles should be floodlit.</para>
              <para>(b)Location: Obstacle floodlights should be arranged so as to illuminate the entire obstacle and, as far as practicable, in a manner so as not to dazzle helicopter pilots.</para>
              <para>(c)Characteristics: Obstacle floodlighting should produce a luminance of at least 10 cd/m2.</para>
