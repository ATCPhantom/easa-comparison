A judicial investigation, a nd consequences of some form, may be expected following an accident or serious incident especially if a failure resulted in lives lost or property damaged, even if no negligence or ill intent existed. A potential issue could, therefore, exist if voluntary hazard reports, which relate to latent deficiencies of a system or its performance, are treated in the same way as those concerning accident, and serious incident investigations. The intent of protecting hazard reports should not challenge the legitimacy o f a judicial investigation, or demand undue immunity.

A judicial investigation, and consequences of some form, may be expected following an accident or serious incident especially if a failure resulted in lives lost or property damaged, even if no negligence or ill intent existed. A potential issue could, therefore, exist if voluntary hazard reports, which relate to latent deficiencies of a system or its performance, are treated in the same way as those concerning accident and serious incident investigations.

Other friction measuring devices can be used, provided they have been correlated with, at least, one of the types mentioned above. A decelerometer should not be used in loose snow or slush, as it can give misleading fr iction values.

A water film of any depth leads to the partial (viscous aquaplaning) or total separation (dynamic aquaplaning) of the tyre from the surface. The smaller the surface, the smaller the force of adhesion, the less braking is available. Therefore, the maximum braking force decreases at higher speed and depends on contaminant depth. Other fluid contaminants have a similar effect. Hard contaminants, such as ice or compacted snow, prevent the contact between tyre and runway surface completely and at any speed, effectively providing a new surface that the tyre rolls on. A deterministic classification of the stopping performance can be made only for the contaminants listed in the RCAM. For other reportable contaminants (oil, mud, ash, etc.), a large variance in the aeroplane performance effect exists, or insufficient data is available to permit a deterministic classification. An exception is rubber contamination, for which in-service data indicates that an assumption of RWYCC 3 provides a satisfactory performance margin.

Below this threshold, any type of fluid contaminant can be removed from the tyre /runway contact zone either by forced drainage or by compressing it into the macrotexture of the surface, thus allowing adhesion between tyre and surface to exist, albeit on less than the full footprint surface area. This is the reason why contamination depths up to 3 mm are expected to provide similar stopping performance as a wet runway. It should be noted that the physical effects causing reduced friction forces begin to take effect from very small film thickness, therefore damp conditions are considered to provide no better braking action than a wet runway. Aerodrome personnel need to be aware of the fact that the capability to generate friction in wet (or with thin layers of fluid contaminants) conditions is very dependent upon the inherent qualities of the runway surface (friction characteristics) and may be less than normally expected on poorly drained, polished or rubber contaminated surfaces. Above the 3 mm threshold, the impact on friction forces is more significant, leading to classification in lower RWYCCs. Above this depth, and depending on the density of the fluid, additional drag effects start to apply, due to displacement or compression of the fluid and impingement on the airframe of the aeroplane. These latter effects depend on the depth of the fluid and affect the ability of the aeroplane to accelerate for take-off.",

Surface temperature is more significant for the relevant physical effects, and surface and air temperature may be significantly different due to latency and radiation. However, surface temperature may not be readily available, and it is acceptable to use air temperature as a criterion for the contaminant classification. The threshold for the classification of compacted snow in RWYCC 4 (below OAT -15 degrees) or RWYCC 3 (above this temperature) is based on historical North American operational practice and may be very conservative, therefore other assessment means should be used to support the classification. Such assessment means should be based upon specific rationale, specific procedures and substantiating aeroplane data.",

The braking action observed is dependent on the type of aircraft, aircraft weight, runway portion used for braking, and other factors. Pilots will use the terms GOOD, GOOD TO MEDIUM, MEDIUM, MEDIUM TO POOR, POOR and LESS THAN POOR. When receiving a special air-report, the recipient needs to consider that it rarely applies to the full length of the runway and is limited to the specific sections of the runway surface in which sufficient wheel braking was applied to reach friction limitation. As special air-reports are subjective and contaminated runways may affect the performance of different aeroplane types in a different way, the reported braking action may not be directly applicable to another aeroplane."

If the lights are directional, they should be orientated so that, as far as possible, their beam s are aligned in the direction from which aircraft or vehicles will approach.

Behaviour is such that a pavement can sustain a definable load for an expected number of repetitions during its design life.

Whether a heater is needed is dependent upon the site location and the weather conditions to which it is exposed.

Application conditions that could have an impact on the expected life of the luminaire include, primarily, the temperature of operation, on-off cycling patterns and humidity. Because LEDs do not have filaments that break or deteriorate, when operated under normal conditions, they tend to last for a long time. However, their light output decreases and the colour of their light shifts over time, with the rate of depreciation increasing at higher-operating temperatures. The implication for practice is that at some point in time the loss of light output or the colour shift may render the LED source outside the specifications for a given application or purpose; while the LEDs may technically still be operating, they would no longer be considered useful.",

In deciding this question, account should need to be taken of the types of aeroplanes which the runway is intended to serve, the limiting visibility and cloud base conditions under which the runway should be used, the position of the obstacles in relation to the threshold and extended centre line, and, in the case of a precision approach runway, the significance of the obstacles to the determination of the obstacle clearance limit.",

A vertical face can be eliminated by chamfering from the top of those constructions to not less than 30 cm below the strip surface level. Other objects situated within the graded portion of the runway strip, the functions of which do not require them to be at surface level, should be buried to a depth of not less tha n 30 cm.

The surface should be pr epared in such a manner as to provide drag to an aircraft and below the surface, it should have sufficient bearing strength to avoid damage to the aircraft. To meet these divergent needs, the following guidelines are provided for preparing the strip. It is noted, that a depth of 15 cm is a depth to which the nose gear may sink without collapsing. Therefore, it is recommended that the soil at a depth of 15 cm below the finished strip surface should be prepared to have a sufficient stability, demonstrated by bearing strength of California Bearing Ratio (CBR) value of 15 to 20. The intention of this is to prevent the nose gear from damage. The top 15 cm may be of lesser strength which would facilitate deceleration of aircraft. There are also other methods for s oil investigation. In case of a deeper sinking than 15 cm, the maximum wheel sinking without collapsing should be examined by using different methods of soil investigation."

On a wet surface at higher speeds a water film may prevent direct contact between the surface asperities and the tire due to insufficient drainage from the tire-to-ground contact area. Microtexture is a built-in quality of the pavement surface. By specifying crushed material that will withstand polishing microtexture , drainage of thin water films are ensured for a longer period of time. Resistance against polishing is expressed in terms of the polished stone values (PSV) which is in principle a value obtained from a friction measurement in accordance with international standards. These standards define the PSV minima that will enable a material with a good microtexture to be selected. A major problem with microtexture is that it can change within short time periods without being easily detected. A typical example of this is the accumulation of rubber deposits in the touchdown area which will largely mask microtexture without necessarily reducing macrotexture.",

The profilometry method has a validity range from 0 to 5 mm mean profile depth (MPD) . The values of MPD and MTD differ due to the finite size of the glass spheres used in the volumetric technique and because the MPD is derived from a two-dimensional profile rather than a three-dimensional surface.

An aircraft taxiing could also endanger aircraft operations when the aircraft location and orientation are so that the aircraft interfere with navigation aids. It is specific to instrument runways and especially important for precision approach runways. The non-penetration of critical/sensitive areas is the first check. The areas within which this degradable interference of course or path signals are possible need to be defined and recognised. For the purposes of developing protective zoning criteria for ILS, these areas are critical areas and sensitive areas. The ILS critical area is an area of defined dimensions about the localizer and glide path antennas where vehicles, including aircraft, are excluded during all ILS operations. The critical area is protected, since the presence of vehicles and/or aircraft inside the critical area boundaries would cause unacceptable disturbance to the ILS signal.

The colour of the pedestal should be chosen to contrast with the colour of the landing ‘T’. Before fastening the landing ‘T’ base to the concrete pedestal, the mounting bolts should be checked for correct spacing. The landing ‘T’ should be assembled and mounted in accordance with the manufacturer’s installation instructions. It should be free to move about a vertical axis so that it can be set in any direction. Where required for use at night, the landing ‘T’ should either be illuminated or outlined by white lights."

            "a) Where a PAPI or APAPI is installed on a runway not equipped with an ILS or MLS, the distance D1 should be calculated to ensure that the lowest height at which a pilot will see a correct approach path indication ( Figure M-5 , angle B for a PAPI and angle A for an APAPI) provides the wheel clearance over the threshold specified in Table M-1 for the most demanding amongst aeroplanes regularly using the runway. b) Where a PAPI or APAPI is installed on a runway equipped with an ILS and/or MLS, the distance D1 should be calculated to provide the optimum compatibility between the visual and non-visual aids for the range of eye-to-antenna heights of the aeroplanes regularly using the runway. The distance should be equal to that between the threshold and the effective origin of the ILS glide path or MLS minimum glide path, as appropriate, plus a correction factor for the variation of eye-to-antenna heights of the aeroplanes concerned. The correction factor is obtained by multiplying the average eye-to-antenna height of those aeroplanes by the cotangent of the approach angle. However, the distance should be such that in no case will the wheel clearance over the threshold be lower than that specified in column (3) of Table M-1. Note: See CS ADR-DSN.L.540  for specifications on aiming point marking. Further guidance on the harmonisation of PAPI, ILS and/or MLS signals is contained in ICAO Doc 9157, Aerodrome Design Manual, Part 4, Visual Aids.",
            "c) If a wheel clearance, greater than that specified in a) above is required for specific aircraft, this can be achieved by increasing D1. d) Distance D1 should be adjusted to compensate for differences in elevation between the lens centres of the light units and the threshold. e) To ensure that units are mounted as low as possible and to allow for any transverse slope, small height adjustments of up to 5 cm between units are acceptable. A lateral gradient not greater than 1.25 per cent can be accepted provided it is uniformly applied across the units. f) A spacing of 6 m (±1 m) between PAPI units should be used on code numbers 1 and 2. In such an event, the inner PAPI unit should be located not less than 10 m (±1 m) from the runway edge. Note: Reducing the spacing between light units results in a reduction in usable range of the system. g) The lateral spacing between APAPI units may be increased to 9 m (±1 m) if greater range is required or later conversion to a full PAPI is anticipated. In the latter case, the inner APAPI unit should be located 15 m (±1 m) from the runway edge."

Pilots are presented with a globally consistent signal which means ‘STOP IMMEDIATELY’ and should be taught to react accordingly. Likewise, pilots receiving an ATS clearance to take-off or cross a runway, and seeing the red light array, should STOP and advise ATS that they aborted/stopped because of the red lights. Again, the criticality of the timeline involved is so tight that there is no room for misinterpretation of the signal.
