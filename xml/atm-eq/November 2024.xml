        <para>EASA eRules: aviation rules for the 21st century</para>
        <para>Rules are the core of the EU civil aviation system. The aim of the EASA eRules project is to make them accessible to stakeholders in an efficient and reliable way.</para>
        <para>EASA eRules is a comprehensive, single system for structuring, sharing, and storing of rules. It is the single, easy-access online database for all aviation safety rules applicable to persons and organisations subject to Basic Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2018/1139).</para>
        <para>The Easy Access Rules (EAR) are the output of the eRules project. The EAR books are consolidated versions of those rules, combining EU regulations with the related EASA Executive Director (ED) decisions in an easy-to-read format with advanced navigation features through links and bookmarks. The EAR books are regularly updated, following the adoption of an official publication.</para>
        <para>The EAR books are available:</para>
        <para>in PDF format;</para>
        <para>as dynamic online publications (online format) with a wide range of functionalities, such as filters to obtain regulatory material tailored to one&#8217;s needs, a search function through the table of contents to quickly access the relevant sections, and easy navigation for computers, tablets, and mobiles; and</para>
        <para>in XML (machine-readable) format that can be easily processed and automated by recipients, producing output that is compatible and can be synchronised with local applications, search databases, etc.</para>
        <para>The EASA eRules system is developed and implemented in close cooperation with the Member States and aviation industry to ensure that all its capabilities are relevant and effective.</para>

            <para>THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,</para>
            <para>Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,</para>
            <para>Having regard to Regulation (EU) 2018/1139 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 4 July 2018 on common rules in the field of civil aviation and establishing a European Union Aviation Safety Agency, and amending Regulations (EC) No 2111/2005, (EC) No 1008/2008, (EU) No 996/2010, (EU) No 376/2014 and Directives 2014/30/EU and 2014/53/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council, and repealing Regulations (EC) No 552/2004 and (EC) No 216/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council and Council Regulation (EEC) No 3922/91 (), and in particular Article 43(1) and Article 62(15), point (c) thereof,</para>
            <para>Whereas:</para>
            <para>(1)Taking into account the objectives and principles set out in Articles 1 and 4 to Regulation (EU) 2018/1139, and in particular the nature and risk of the activity concerned, organisations involved in the design or production of air traffic management/air navigation service (ATM/ANS) systems and ATM/ANS constituents, should be required to hold a certificate.</para>
            <para>(2)In order to ensure the uniform implementation of and compliance with the essential requirements referred to in Article 40 of Regulation (EU) 2018/1139, for the provision of ATM/ANS this Regulation should lay down rules and procedures for issuing, maintaining, amending, limiting, suspending or revoking the certificates for organisations involved in the design or production of ATM/ANS systems and ATM/ANS constituents, as well as the privileges and responsibilities of the holders of certificates.</para>
            <para>(3)The conformity assessment of ATM/ANS equipment laid down in Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2023/ 1768 () depends on the nature and the risk of the ATM/ANS service, or on the functionality of a particular ATM/ANS equipment and is based on the existing methodologies and best practices. That Regulation establishes three different types of conformity assessment, in particular: a certification by the Agency of certain ATM/ANS equipment; a declaration by an approved organisation involved in the design or production of ATM/ANS equipment; and a statement of compliance by the ATM/ANS provider or by an approved organisation involved in the design or production of ATM/ANS equipment.</para>
            <para>(4)The typical life cycle of ATM/ANS equipment consists of various phases: design, production, installation, operation, maintenance, and decommission. The ATM/ANS provider is usually responsible for some of those phases, while for other phases the organisations involved in the design or production of ATM/ANS equipment are responsible. Therefore, common requirements should be established for the approval and oversight of organisations involved in the design or production of certain ATM/ANS equipment used in the provision of ATM/ANS, in particular those referred to in point 3.1 of Annex VIII to Regulation (EU) 2018/1139.</para>
            <para>(5)The European Union Aviation Safety Agency (&#8216;the Agency&#8217;) is responsible for all competent authority tasks related to certificates and declarations for ATM/ANS systems and ATM/ANS constituents (&#8216;ATM/ANS equipment&#8217;), including oversight and enforcement. To ensure consistency and risk-based assessment and, amongst others, to avoid duplication and administrative burdens, as well as to promote effectiveness in certification and oversight processes, those oversight and enforcement functions should be exercised by the Agency. For the purpose of certification or review of declarations of ATM/ANS equipment, it is necessary that the Agency also oversees the processes established by design and production organisations, including, where necessary, the certification of those organisations. Therefore, the Agency should be responsible for the approval of the organisations involved in the design or production of ATM/ANS equipment and at the same time for the attestation of ATM/ANS equipment.</para>
            <para>(6)The competency of the Agency to certify design or production organisations should allow also for a non- discriminatory and harmonised approach towards all design or production organisations applying for a certificate under this Regulation. ATM/ANS equipment put on the market in the Union can be used in all Member States and for all kind of services, no matter whether it is used by ATM/ANS providers active in one or more Member States. It is not possible to categorise the organisations involved in the design and production based on their future catalogue of equipment to be used on a local or Union level. The same principle is to be observed when the Agency is allocating certification and oversight tasks.</para>
            <para>(7)In accordance with Article 29(2), point (a), of Regulation (EU) 2021/696 () of the European Parliament and of the Council, the European Union Agency for the Space Programme (EUSPA) has been entrusted with the task of managing the exploitation of the European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service (EGNOS), as provided for in Article 44 of that Regulation. The exploitation of EGNOS covers, amongst other actions, the support to certification and standardisation activities. EUSPA does not perform alone all the tasks relating to the exploitation of EGNOS and instead relies on the expertise of other entities, in particular the European Space Agency (ESA), on activities related to system evolution, design and development of parts of the ground segment. Hence EUSPA should be considered as equivalent to a design or production organisation in the context of this Regulation.</para>
            <para>(8)According to the roles and responsibilities defined in Regulation (EU) 2021/696 for EUSPA and ESA, there is not one unique entity responsible for the design of the EGNOS system and its equipment and therefore there is not a single Design and Production Organisation that could be approved by EASA.</para>
            <para>(9)Consequently, the specificities of the set-up for the design of the EGNOS system require specific means for the demonstration of compliance with the essential requirements laid down in Regulation (EU) 2018/1139, taking into account that EGNOS is a multimodal service, which should also comply with relevant regulatory requirements for other sectors.</para>
            <para>(10)Both agencies should cooperate to assure compliance of the EGNOS system with the relevant ICAO standards so that respective arrangements ensure a level of safety and interoperability equivalent to that resulting from the full application of the requirements for design and production in this Regulation. The cooperation will also include the consultation of EUSPA in the development of detailed specifications.</para>
            <para>(11)This Regulation has taken due account of the content of the ATM Master Plan and technological capabilities contained in it.</para>
            <para>(12)The Agency has prepared draft implementing rules and submitted them to the Commission with Opinion No 01/2023 in accordance with Article 75(2), points (b) and (c), and Article 76(1) of Regulation (EU) 2018/1139.</para>
            <para>(13)In order to make optimal use of existing resources and expertise, the Agency may seek administrative support when executing its certification, oversight and enforcement tasks under this Regulation from national competent authorities. This administrative support should not constitute any delegation of powers or responsibilities of tasks.</para>
            <para>(14)In order to include design or production organisations of ATM/ANS equipment in the scope of the management of information security risks with a potential impact on aviation safety Implementing Regulation (EU) 2023/203 should be amended.</para>
            <para>(15)The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee referred to in Article 127(1) of Regulation (EU) 2018/1139.</para>

                <para>(a)A DPO, responsible for ensuring that the design of the ATM/ANS equipment complies with the applicable certification basis requirements or detailed specifications used for the declaration of design compliance, as applicable, should ensure that components designed, or tasks performed, by external parties are acceptable. To discharge this responsibility, the DPO should implement documented methods that ensure the compliance of the finished (ready to be delivered) ATM/ANS equipment, and that make use of these components or task results, prior to issuing the final EASA release form.</para>
                <para>(b)As the responsibility for verification of compliance remains with the DPO, no specific qualification measures are required other than to pragmatically verify the capabilities of the external party, and to ensure that the required level of detail is met to enable the task results to be adequately verified.</para>
                <para>(c)If a DPO subcontracts the compliance monitoring function to an external party that conducts the task, but does not hold its own DPO approval, then the same requirements for the qualification, nomination and documentation apply to the person who is nominated and indicated in the DPO handbook of the contracting DPO.</para>
                <para>(d)Alternatively, if an organisation with a DPO approval obtains design substantiation data from a subcontractor that also holds a DPO approval, and the work that is conducted is within the approved scope of this subcontractor DPO, the subcontractor&#8217;s design data becomes acceptable when the contracting DPO has verified that the results adequately meet the needs of the ATM/ANS equipment under development. Additional formal compliance verification by the contracting DPO is not required if the person responsible for compliance verification of the contracted DPO signs and approves the document under its DPO approval.</para>

            <para>THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,</para>
            <para>Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,</para>
            <para>Having regard to Regulation (EU) 2018/1139 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 4 July 2018on common rules in the field of civil aviation and establishing a European Union Aviation Safety Agency, and amending Regulations (EC) No 2111/2005, (EC) No 1008/2008, (EU) No 996/2010, (EU) No 376/2014 and Directives 2014/30/EU and 2014/53/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council, and repealing Regulations (EC) No 552/2004 and (EC) No 216/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council and Council Regulation (EEC) No 3922/91(), and in particular Articles 47(1) and 62(13),</para>
            <para>Whereas:</para>
            <para>(1)Regulation (EU) 2018/1139 establishes common essential requirements to provide for a high uniform level of civil aviation safety in the Union and to ensure that the integrity and safety-related performance of systems and constituents are fit for their intended purpose. The interoperability of the air traffic management/air navigation service (ATM/ANS) systems and ATM/ANS constituents should ensure the seamless operation of the European air traffic management network (EATMN).</para>
            <para>(2)Detailed specifications should be established to ensure compliance with the essential requirements; those detailed specifications should whenever possible rely on recognised industry standards from Standards Developing Organisations (SDOs) that reflect the state of the art and best design practices. The design and production of ATM/ANS systems and ATM/ANS constituents should be carried out with consideration given to requirements to issue certification and declarations of design compliance and in line with detailed specifications issued by the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (&#8216;the Agency&#8217;).</para>
            <para>(3)It is appropriate to establish different attestation methods for assessing conformity with the requirements set out in an Annex to this Regulation and detailed specifications of ATM/ANS systems and ATM/ANS constituents. More stringent attestation methods should be used as regards the safe operation of aircraft, and as regards equipment that is critical in terms of the interoperability and security of the EATMN.</para>
            <para>(4)Within the ATM/ANS, the air traffic control (ATC) services are the most important as regards the safety risks related to navigation of aircraft, in particular due to issuing instructions to ensure aircraft separation and collision avoidance. Providers of ATC have the most complete view regarding the safety of the airspace. Therefore, the most critical ATM/ANS equipment, namely the equipment supporting ATC should be subject to more stringent attestation methods, namely certification.</para>
            <para>(5)ATM/ANS equipment that supports air-to-ground communications delivers direct instructions to aircraft and should be subject to certification too.</para>
            <para>(6)The Communication, Surveillance, and Navigation services are used directly by the ATS to ensure safe navigation of aircraft, but the three services referred to do not have a complete view of traffic and do not play an active control over aircraft separation. Consequently, they play a less critical role. The ATM/ANS systems and ATM/ANS constituents that support them should be subject to a less stringent attestation method, namely declaration of design compliance.</para>
            <para>(7)Lastly, other less critical ATM/ANS systems and equipment that support meteorological services, aeronautical information services, airspace management services and air traffic flow management services should be subject to the least stringent attestation method, namely statement of compliance.</para>
            <para>(8)Additional criteria are possible to decide on criticality of ATM/ANS systems and ATM/ANS constituents in addition to the managerial control over safety risks of the services and functions that they support.</para>
            <para>(9)Therefore, three different levels of requirements and detailed specifications should be established, namely: (i) certification by the Agency, the most stringent level; (ii) declaration by an approved organisation involved in the design or production of ATM/ANS equipment, the medium level; and (iii) statement of compliance by the ATM/ANS provider that integrates the ATM/ANS equipment into its functional system, as defined in Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2017/373(), or, upon ATM/ANS provider&#8217;s request, by an approved organisation involved in the design or production of ATM/ANS equipment.</para>
            <para>(10)In accordance with Article 29(2), point (a), of Regulation (EU) 2021/696 of the European Parliament and of the Council(), the European Union Agency for the Space Programme (EUSPA) has been entrusted with managing the European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service (EGNOS), including the exploitation of EGNOS that covers, amongst other actions, support to certification and standardisation efforts.</para>
            <para>(11)Under Regulation (EU) 2021/696 both EUSPA and the European Space Agency (ESA) are responsible for the design of the EGNOS system and its equipment. The Agency should oversee the declarations of design compliance of the equipment of EGNOS in accordance with specific arrangements to be concluded with EUSPA. Those arrangements are to address technical, administrative, and financial aspects such as a requirement to consult EUSPA as regards the development of detailed specifications; the oversight by EASA of the declarations of design compliance of the EGNOS system; and the exchange of data between both agencies regarding the relevant International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Standards and Recommended Practices (SARPS) compliance. Those arrangements are to ensure a level of safety and interoperability equivalent to the requirements of this Regulation.</para>
            <para>(12)In certain remote territories, outside the ICAO European (EUR) region as defined in the European (EUR) Air Navigation Plan Volume I (Doc 7754) of ICAO, with low traffic volume and where that airspace borders only with airspace under the responsibility of third-country ATM/ANS providers, the application of the attestation methods of certification and declaration of design compliance of ATM/ANS equipment may be challenging or even unfeasible, due to their specific safety and interoperability needs. In such cases, for ATM/ANS equipment that is used by ATM/ANS providers in remote areas outside of the ICAO EUR region, it is deemed appropriate to provide derogations from the certification or declaration requirements applicable to such ATM/ANS equipment. Instead, in order to provide for safe and interoperable provision of ATM/ANS, the ATM/ANS provider in that region needs to ensure that applicable specifications are being met by issuing a statement of compliance.</para>
            <para>(13)It is necessary to ensure a smooth transition to the new regulatory framework established by this Regulation and to ensure that a high and uniform level of civil aviation safety in the Union is maintained. It is therefore necessary to provide sufficient time for the design and manufacturing industry of the ATM/ANS systems and ATM/ANS constituents, and for the Agency and Member States&#8217; administrations to adapt to this new framework. It is appropriate that the ATM/ANS equipment that is in operation and that was attested under the previous framework is considered as if it had been issued with certificates or declarations issued under the new framework during a transition period, unless the Agency states that such equipment does not ensure the level of safety and interoperability required by Regulation (EU) 2018/1139.</para>
            <para>(14)During the transition period, as regards any new ATM/ANS system and ATM/ANS constituent put into operation, a statement of compliance, issued by the ATM/ANS provider that integrates it in its functional system, or, upon request, by the design and production organisation that designs and manufactures it, should be submitted to the competent authority of the referred ATM/ANS provider defined in Article 4(1) of Implementing Regulation (EU) 2017/373.</para>
            <para>(15)After the transition period the Agency should be solely responsible for certification and for receiving declarations concerning certain ATM/ANS equipment; it is therefore appropriate for the Agency to evaluate the compliance information submitted to national authorities under the previous framework, before such ATM/ANS equipment comes under the remit of the Agency. Therefore, national authorities should make this information available to the Agency. After the evaluation by the Agency, the ATM/ANS equipment should be deemed to have been issued with a certificate or declaration of compliance. The evaluation needs to be made public by decision of the Agency&#8217;s executive director.</para>
            <para>(16)The measures provided for in this Regulation are based on Opinion No 01/2023, issued by the European Union Aviation Safety Agency in accordance with Article 75(2), points (b) and (c), and Article 76(1) of Regulation (EU) 2018/1139,</para>

              <para>(a)To issue a SoC for ATM/ANS equipment, the ATM/ANS provider must perform the necessary verification and test activities, as required. The competent authority oversees the SoC as part of the management of changes to the functional system or during the continuous oversight of the ATM/ANS provider and, as necessary, applies enforcement measures to the ATM/ANS provider. Figure 3 shows the interactions between the regulated parties when the ATM/ANS equipment is subject to a SoC and such SoC is issued by the ATM/ANS provider.</para>
              <para>Figure 3</para>
              <para>(b)A DPO can obtain privileges in accordance with the terms of the EASA approval to issue a SoC on behalf of an ATM/ANS provider, upon its request. There is an expectation that DPOs apply all processes and procedures under its EASA&#8217;s approval terms for such ATM/ANS equipment in accordance with Implementing Regulation (EU) 2023/1769, although this is not explicitly required, and thus, an EASA release form may be issued. Such EASA release form will provide additional assurance to competent authorities that finished ATM/ANS equipment ready to be delivered has been manufactured in conformity with the design data. The competent authority oversees the SoC as part of the management of changes to the functional system or during the continuous oversight of the ATM/ANS provider. If, during the continuous oversight of the ATM/ANS provider, the competent authority identifies any non-compliance of the SoC, that competent authority will inform EASA about any enforcement measures required. Figure 4 shows the interactions between the regulated parties when the ATM/ANS equipment is subject to a SoC and such SoC is issued by the DPO.</para>

                <para>Certificates of ATM/ANS equipment issued in accordance with Article 4 and declarations of design compliance of ATM/ANS equipment issued in accordance with Article 5 lose their validity in case the holder of the certificate/issuer of the declaration of design compliance is no longer compliant with Implementing Regulation (EU) 2023/1769.</para>
                <para>In the above situations, EASA would typically:</para>
                <para>(a)revoke the certificate or deregister the declaration of design compliance, as appropriate;</para>
                <para>(b)inform ATM/ANS providers that are users of the ATM/ANS equipment concerned and their competent authorities, as in the absence of an approved DPO with appropriate privileges from that moment on:</para>
                <para>the affected ATM/ANS equipment cannot be integrated into any functional system as the requirements in ATM/ANS.OR.A.045 (g) of Implementing Regulation (EU) 2017/373 will be no longer met;</para>
                <para>the affected ATM/ANS equipment already integrated intoa functional system cannot be modified until a valid certificate or declaration is in place, in accordance with points ATM/ANS.OR.A.045 (g)(1) and (g)(2) of Implementing Regulation (EU) 2017/373. This requires another DPO with appropriate privileges to take responsibility for the compliance of the equipment with the applicable technical specifications;</para>
                <para>the continuous operation of the ATM/ANS equipment already integrated into the functional system of ATM/ANS providers may not necessarily be immediately impacted. However, ATM/ANS providers will have to consider how the absence of the DPO impacts the suitability for use of the equipment, the defined conditions of use, and any prescribed limitations; and</para>
                <para>(c)issue an ATM/ANS equipment directive to replace the ATM/ANS equipment concerned in case an unsafe, insecure, under-performing or non-interoperability condition has been identified or is likely to develop, as in the absence of a DPO with appropriate privileges and responsibility for ensuring that the equipment continues complying with the applicable technical specifications,design changes to the ATM/ANS equipment to restore performance are not possible.This ATM/ANS equipment directive will be addressed to all known users of the ATM/ANS equipment and their competent authorities.</para>
                <para>Note: In case the DPO approval is still valid, e.g. during a suspension/revocation process, EASA will require the DPO to make appropriate descriptive data and accomplishment instructions available to all known users of the ATM/ANS equipment and their competent authorities.</para>
                <para>Urgent operational needs might require certain exceptions to the principles described above, allowing integration or modification of equipment without a valid certificate or declaration. In those cases, the exemptions are to be managed under the flexibility provisions in Article 71 of Regulation (EU) 2018/1139, subject to all relevant conditions laid down in such article. In particular, the Member State must provide adequate justification for the following aspects:</para>
                <para>(1)it is not possible for another DPO to obtain a valid certificate or issue a declaration for the equipment;</para>
                <para>(2)safety, environmental protection and compliance with the applicable essential requirements are ensured, where necessary through the application of mitigation measures;</para>
                <para>(3)any possible distortion of market conditions as a consequence of the granting of the exemption will be mitigated as far as possible; and</para>
                <para>(4)the exemption is limited in scope and duration to the extent strictly necessary and it is applied in a non-discriminatory manner; and</para>
                <para>(d)take any other necessary further enforcement measures which are necessary to mitigate the consequences of the discontinuation of a DPO approval.</para>

              <para>other items, if considered to be more appropriate, that are relevant to the specific ATM/ANS equipment.</para>
              <para>A special emphasis on novelties being part of the design (e.g. new technologies, new materials, etc.) and peculiarities of the configuration will be included. The certification programme must be detailed enough, in particular on aspects related to novelty and complexity, to allow EASA to properly estimate its level of involvement as required by pointATM/ANS.EQMT.AR.B.010.</para>
              <para>Certification aspects</para>
              <para>The following information related to certification will be provided:</para>
              <para>a proposal for the initial certification basis, in accordance with point ATM/ANS.EQMT.CERT.015(b)(2)(iv), including applicable detailed specifications, reference to special conditions, and reference to equivalent safety findings;</para>

              <para>aproposal for limitations that are expected at the time of establishing the certification programme; and</para>
              <para>the identification of applicable industry standards, certification memoranda, and guidance material. Where AMC to detailed specifications specifies a certain industry standard(s), and the applicant does not elect to comply with it (them) (partly or completely), the certification programme must identify the request to deviate from the AMC, propose alternative industry standard(s), and demonstrate its (their) equivalence.</para>
              <para>For equipment embedding software, the description will identify the main failure conditions that will drive the architecture of the equipment, the classification of the software assurance level (SWAL) to use, and any associated assumption made to define the SWAL.</para>
              <para>Equipment configuration</para>
              <para>The certification programme must define the equipment model name, part number, and provide the means to configure anticipated minor changes when previously agreed with EASA as part of the DPO change management procedure as required in point DPO.OR.B.005(b) of Implementing Regulation (EU) 2023/1769.</para>
              <para>Demonstration of compliance</para>
              <para>The certification programmewill include the following, as far as this information is available at the time of submission to EASA:</para>
              <para>the proposed means of compliance, and the related compliance document(s) as specified in Appendix 1;</para>
              <para>identification of technical procedures, technical documents and specifications thatwere followed in the demonstration of compliance;</para>
              <para>when the compliance demonstration involves testing, a description of the test article(s), test method(s), test location(s), test schedule, test house(s), test conditions, as well as of the intent/objective(s) of the testing; and</para>
              <para>when the compliance demonstration involves analyses/calculations, a description/identification of the tools (e.g. name and version/release of the software programmes) and methods used, the associated assumptions, limitations and/or conditions, as well as of the intended use and purpose; furthermore, the validation and verification of such tools and methods will be addressed.</para>
              <para>For every aspect mentioned above, the applicant will clearly identify whether the demonstration of compliance involves any method (analysis or test) which is novel to or unusual for the applicant.</para>
              <para>The applicant will detail the list of documents generated during the development and that will be used to demonstrate compliance with the applicable certification basis.</para>
              <para>The applicant will break down the certification programme into one or more meaningful groups of compliance-demonstration activities and data, in accordance with point ATM/ANS.EQMT.CERT.015(b)(2)(v), hereafter referred to as compliance-demonstration items(CDIs), and provide their proposal for EASA&#8217;s LoI.</para>
              <para>A CDI will be used as a meaningful group of compliance-demonstration activities and data identified in the certification programme which can be considered in isolation for the purpose of performing the certification risk assessment that allows EASA to determine its LoI using a risk-based approach.</para>
              <para>The applicant must provide sufficient detailed information about the novelty, complexity, and criticality aspects of the proposed CDI.</para>
              <para>Desing organisation and schedule aspects</para>
              <para>Identification of the relevant personnel who make decisions affecting safety, security and interoperability, and who will interface with EASA, unless otherwise communicated to EASA (e.g. within the DPO procedures);</para>
